1,org.wordpress.android,126.74766355140186,2,2,"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white."

So, I wrote to the developer. No reply after a month, I wrote back. No reply after two weeks. ------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem). Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone. Gone! (The SD is 32 GB and has 31 GB free) I wrote the developer. After a week- no reply. ---------- Uninstall Warning: Each time I uninstalled the app., a large folder (Over 1 GB on mine) was left behind on the phone. One must use a file manager to delete it. --------- I Give Up (Which is too bad because this app is easy to use.) UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions. I had already tried (multiple times) what is suggested in the links the person posted. I also had already sent e-mails to the address shown. I will try one more time to contact them (because it looks like a fun & easy app). If no luck, I'll have to conclude that my phone and this app just won't play well together. UPDATE- Developer replied to this review and asked me for the name I used to contact them. I won't post my e-mail here. (That's not a comfortable thing to do.) I sent a new e-maill to them. I will update the review & star rating when (if) they reply & tell me how to make this application work."
3,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,109.59813084112149,3,0,"Great potential but needs bug fixes Of course, I like the idea of having an off-line map. I downloaded a few of them. They seem fairly accurate, easy to read and have a lot of very useful details by default without decreasing the readability. So from that point of view I would give at least 4 stars. Now it keeps freezing on me if I touch any of the controls Search, Download Maps (I can download only by using the map itself), Settings at the bottom of the screen. Also some details (such as shops and bus stops are missing) and at least in one case a bus stop would show only at a specific scale. So I am only giving 3 stars right now but there is a great potential for an excellent app... PS. And I also like the fact they try to answer most of the reviewers when appropriate!"
4,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,106.16822429906541,1,16,"The only use for this app over google is it shows trails and jungle footpaths. After that its 'EFFING USELESS. The pointer spins constantly so you cant tell which way you're facing. It points 180 degrees out and the blue dotted line follows you, ie it can send you back the way you came and not leave your start point blank....so you still think youre going the right way as youre always attached to the dotted line. It should let the pointer move away from the dotted line, then you can see youre off course. If you brush the screen it opens a new dropped pin which then deletes the path you were following. I cant bookmark anything. Theres paths highlighted in red that i didnt add, it constantly directs you to road routes even tho i only want mountain footpaths and have it set to walking. It does work offline for me which is 1 reason not to boot it just yet but its useless to navigate with, i use it just to look for trails. Thankfully im not getting ads cos thailand auto blocks anything that isnt of profit directly to them.

Missing ""do not download"" option in map diwnload dialog window. Unable to configure localisation of the map directory. Menu bar disappears at random? Navigation proposes routes violating the law and mistakes public roads with field roads.  After update navigation is much worse. No perspective view despite it is enabled in settings. Calculating a route is slow, arrival estimation changed from optimistic (below 4h) to pessimistic (over 8h) for a route Krapkowice-Warszawa (Poland, realistic estimate ca 5h). Rerouting freezes very often.  Figured out how to enable perspective view. I had to disable it, close the app, reopen the app and enable it. I fear of other bugs."
6,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,100.20560747663552,2,0,"Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed. If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did."

MapWithMe Pro has a nice mapping interface it works great on my 7.0, but *The app doesn't do navigation or street address search but merely shows you as a dot on a map which is the same as the free version. *The search feature add to the Pro version is very limited: not worth the money. * The Samsung 7.0 comes with, Latitude, for free and gives you the ability to download maps for offline uses and work just as good.  What I would like to see is point to point navigation and a more in depth search . If you drive into a GPS black out area a offline mapping system is nice to have limited uses to get you back on track."

10,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,94.57009345794393,1,2,"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on..."
11,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,93.75700934579439,1,1,"Effectively useless for cycle routing. I downloaded this to get cycle routing which Google maps doesn't offer in Central America. Maps.Me does do cycle routing but it's effectively useless. First, it only offers you one route to your destination, so if you were thinking about taking another road, too bad, maps.me will not show you how long that road might be. You only get the one suggestion and no others, and no way to make it give you other options.  Second, there's clearly a compulsion by the app to avoid anything it thinks is a highway at all costs. So you end up with totally bizarre and out of the way routes when there's a direct road from you to your destination. This avoidance of highways would be ok if you were given more than one route to choose from, or you could turn off the 'avoid highways' preference. Unfortunately this is not possible. All of this might be fine in the US or Western Europe, but in Mexico and Central America if a road doesn't have a number (and is nominally a highway) it probably isn't paved. So avoiding anything with a number is basically going to be sending you along a lot of dirt roads. The app is also then also avoiding lots of rural highways, totally quiet, beautiful, no traffic, two lane roads.   Finally, they made a big deal with an update that made the app display an elevation profile for cycle routes too. This is a big deal for cyclists, as it's important to know the hills you have in front of you (or at least on the one route the app wants you to take). Sadly, this elevation profile is effectively useless too. The profile had nothing on it to show scale, so you have no idea how high the individual peaks are. There is one number given next to an up/down arrow symbol which I think must be net gain??? Or maybe it's total gain??  I really have no idea. And honestly, if you're going to give me one number, give me the highest altitude I'll reach on that route. From there I can guestimate the other climbs.  Maybe the app is ideal for driving. Maybe it works better for cyclists in cities. I don't know. I do know that it's pretty useless for me, except in the rare circumstances that the app and I are in agreement about which road to take."
12,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,93.30841121495327,3,1,"I almost rated this for stars. It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers).  There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though. Primarily this is just in not having locations. For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by.  Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours).  It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.  Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters.  Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are)."

14,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,90.42990654205607,2,1,"Too many ads. Even more than Google Maps. At least most of the features work in a general sense; just not in my area.  EDIT: I understand that advertising is a resource that allows for development to continue, but you must understand the current default implementation makes any features very unappealing and the entire experience unenjoyable. I uninstalled imediately after the second push ad. Push ads are unacceptable in any form.  I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature. DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background. There are better ways to let users know of features. For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched. This is more benificial for you as well, because a user is more likely to follow through when they have already chosen to engage with the app, as opposed to you trying to pull them away from whatever else they may be doing."
15,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,88.65420560747663,3,0,"Decent app. Tried out a few offline nav apps that use osm for data and this had the best looking map display for me. Clean and clear display during navigation a plus. Suggested nav routes were generally good, but did not care for the inability to ignore toll roads as well as to get more than one suggested route. The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point. Another suggestion would be to improve the display functions during navigation, ie: speedometer/speeding warnings, lane assist, and fixed speed cameras. Needs improvements but a solid app overall."
16,org.wordpress.android,88.59813084112149,1,1,"Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor. This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images. It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor. Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started. Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface. I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible."
17,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,86.0,1,5,"This app has gone downhill. Now that Google maps supports offline maps there is absolutely no reason to use this app. It still causes my device to restart. No other app makes my phone restart, only this one. It uses a dodgy background process that makes my phone restart even after I finish using app. They need to add a ""exit"" button to properly close the app. It keeps running services in background even when I force quit the app via task manager. It crams a lot of junk and annoyances in the app. I don't want business names or the ability to rate or share or whatever other junk they force in there. Let me turn all the junk off so I can use the map like a map. Stop asking me to turn on location settings.

While doing a search on a street, it's very unresponsive when I press on the street that has already come up in the search results.  Also, no way to enter a street number. Which seems pretty basic and shocking that it doesn't allow user to specify a street number!   Disappointing. I just spent 20 minutes trying to enter in the address of a location.   Suggest you hire some UI designers and product managers to do a better job redesigning this app, to be user friendly and make it easy for users to do simple things, like actually entering in an address!  In response to Developer's ""fixing"" the 2 missing EXAMPLE addresses I listed, that's like a drop  in the ocean. The problem is NOT simply that it couldn't locate the 2 EXAMPLE addresses I listed. The problem is deeper. It was unable to properly locate an arbitrary, VALID, address. This is something Google Maps can do EASILY.

OSM doesn't really  support proper Address searching so relying solely on this isn't possible.  I have to go back to Google to find actual full addresses.

The main problem I have with it on that front is that the way it displays lead images in article headers often cuts off important parts of the image; see for example Hammerton Killick- it cuts off his head!   Editing is more problematic - talk pages are impossible to get to, as is article history. Talk and history can be beneficial for readers as well as they give valuable info about reliability and sources of content."
21,com.mapswithme.maps.pro,82.67289719626169,2,1,"I wanted to like this app. I'm looking for an alternative to google maps. The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account. The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode. If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first. But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless. There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first. I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this. I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up."

You have to stop the app restart it with GPS already enabled and it seems to work for the most part but it was very spotty and it makes it extremely hard to use if you don't have time to stop and park and occasionally I had to hit the lower left button to make it connect again if it stopped working.

Note that i read your FAQ. This is the only GPS app i know that cannot route you to an international airport and i had the same pb with addresses on public roads. 4TH ANSWER TO DEVELS: no i am not contacting you, i use a better app and our exchange was unpleasant, it is enough."

There are buttons that just look like explanatory text and other things that look like buttons that aren't.  If I hatch a new pet or try to make a new change to my avatar it can sometimes take several minutes for the app to recognize and show the change, meanwhile I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.  The entire party structure and invitation setup is needlessly complicated and frustrating.  The actual task/to do list setup is great.

Amusing on the autobahn, but a real pain when driving slowly or walking in a city center or small village. Gives very short notice for lane changes/exits.

They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work.

It does a decent job of helping you navigate around city's. However it is borderline useless when navigating great distances. It only offers one route and it is always the most direct route. That means if the most direct route is through the center of a massive city as supposed to using a ring road. It's taking you through the city. This has happened to me a few times while using maps.me and since I don't know the area it's bitten me in the ass almost everytime. Something that would take 30min using the ring roads instead takes 2hrs because you have to go through the whole city. It also has a very hard time rerouting. Several times I followed the road signs instead of the app and it refused to reroute, it didn't even reroute a turn around. It just kept spinning the map in circles.

The app renders OK and quickly, but that is already all there is. Quite frankly, other apps based on the skobbler engine draw nicely and very smoothly. In many cases the offline cache of Google Maps is good enough (Japan) and in other areas Google Maps data can actually be downloaded explicitly for a defined region. There is massive room for improvement here.  [Adressing the response to the review: It is not that features are ""bad"". It is the lack of features which I am a bit unhappy about. Combine the (OSM data-driven) features of ""Locus Map"", ""GPS Navigation & Maps"" and ""MapFactor: GPS Navigation"" with the existing feature set and get a very nice app. Aggregate *more* data, make the OSM data more accessible, see for instance the email conversation we had three months ago.

Kudus! 2 .- I have received few times failures in planning a walk, and was advised to define a different start or end point.  I fail to understand both. 3. There is a very unstable behavior you need to solve. When walking along a planned path, even a very straight one, the view keep rotating clockwise and back. This is annoying behavior. 4. When walking along a plan path, the software does not take care to move the visible map window, therefore I have to take care of this. 5. It should be possible to decide which data layer is drawn. For example, when I look for a monument and the search can not find it and I want to finger choose it, I don't want to see icons of restaurants. 6. There should be integrated icon explanation. 7.

Great but you won't get a reminder about it. Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities. And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it.

Even using  waypoints results in backtracking and crossing into Afghanistan. If maps  won't take the time to figure where it is legal to use highways, they  should at least make using highways an option.

Sometimes for a minute, or 2, or 5, sometimes it just hung and you had to kill the app and restart it. The voice announcements still worked (as did the speed indicator), but since this app's turn-by-turn instructions are often ambiguous and sometimes just plain wrong, you can't rely on them, so having a frozen map is really the worst thing for navigation. We lost quite a bit of time around Arnhem, Oosterbeek, Nijmegen, etc. having to stop at the side of the road to restart the navigation.
