1,com.evernote,257.56493506493507,1,2,"Cannot edit app.  Just sucks.  Supposed to be able to edit, but crashes each time I hit the edit button.   Really sucks when you are out and about and have to write everything down on paper and wait until you get back to the office.  Sucks again.  Need some sort of an update for this app.  (Android)  Got an email from Evernote:  1.  Open Evernote 2.  Tap on the three dots in the upper right corner. 3.  Click on ""Settings,"" ""Support,"" ""Send Activity Logs."" Did that, except in Settings, there was no ""Support"" button, thus, no ""Send Activity Log""  And, here I am paying for the ""Premium"" feature of Evernote.  So, looking for an alternative with ""support"" I downloaded Microsoft One Note.  Don't like it as much, but it is new and at least I can edit the app information.  And, they have constant updates. So, guess what?  I am slowly but surely transitioning from Evernote over to One Note.  Well, there doesn't seem to be an additional review so I will add to this one.  First, I praise Evernote for their PC version of this program.  Having said that, the tablet version of Evernote is a very poor excuse of an attempt to create something that works.  You can read the info that you have stored but that is about it.  I have found another program that works, and works well.  So after having written this note, I am forthwith deleting the Tablet version of Evernote from this tablet.  This goes with an admonition to read all the review of this app program prior to downloading it to your phone or tablet.  PS:  There is absolutely no credible support from Evernote for this app."
2,com.evernote,254.28571428571428,3,2,"One step forwards, two steps backwards (UPDATE#2)   Material design is in the right direction, BUT The overlap text bug that was fixed in the previous version IS BACK. Also, the formatting bar is taking more space on a tablet, when it used to share the space with the top bar. Still waiting for ability to add tables, change fonts and colours.  (UPDATE#1)  Another bug unfortunately is when I paste an image from Chrome, only a small pink box appears. When I save the note, I can see the image fine, but now I am unable to edit the note properly because it tells me that the ""format is not supported"". Please help!  PS. Saving the image on the device, and then attaching it to Evernote is fine, but is so much less efficient.   Change also the text search highlight colour from yellow to something else because it is easily confused with the normal text highlighter! (It is orange on iOS, making it even more confusing!)"
3,com.evernote,246.05194805194805,1,1,"New Upgrade = Loss of Functionality Evernote automatically updated on 9/4/14. I use this app daily as part of my GTD-. I use the tags as my contexts and the notebooks to group Next Actions, Follow Up Items, etc. When I pull up a tag, I need the notes grouped by Notebook, but since the upgrade, I have lost the ability to see a snippet of the note content if I sort my notes this way. The only way to see this info is to sort by ""Date Created"" or ""Recently Update"" which is totally useless for me. Would not have ""upgraded"" if I would have known about this.  Also, why can't the sort be set differently if you are on Notebook vs. Tag vs. All Notes? E.G. when I select notebooks, sort by title but when I switch to tags, sort by notebook? It's very frustrating to constantly have to switch on the fly."
4,com.evernote,242.21428571428572,1,0,"COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!! Yesterday I spent nearly an hour editing a note and adding all kinds of info to it. When I was done I saved it, and I saw the notification that said it was successfully uploaded to evernote. I was able to go back and look at the note and everything was there. a little bit later I tried to start a new note (using the button on the old widget -- DONT touch that after you update to the latest version!!!) but instead of opening up a blank template for a new note, IT OPENED UP THE PREVIOUS UNEDITED VERSION OF MY OTHER NOTE... from before I spent all that time adding all the additional info. There is absolutely no way of cancelling out without uploading/saving it, so this POS app saved this version of my note, completely overwriting and eliminating all the additional info I had worked so hard to create.  what's even WORSE!!... I spent another hour fixing that note, adding all the additional info back in, and later that night when I tried to create another new note... SAME GD PROBLEM AGAIN!!!! i would be surprised if they didn't do this on purpose to try to get people to upgrade to the premium version where you can see your note history. no thanks a-holes, I'm never using evernote again!"
5,com.evernote,236.0974025974026,2,7,"I'm sick of this app mangling and corrupting nearly everything I type! This had been an issue with the Android client for years and recently started plaguing the Windows app. Words and letters often jump around randomly while trying to edit lists and checkboxes, or during copy and paste. Sometimes entire sentences disappear or move to the top or bottom line, with word order jumbled up. Years ago I used the app every day, but now I actively avoid using it as it fills me with dread. I don't know how many notes I've lost due to word corruption. Tags are used instead of folders, so there's absolutely no separation between work or personal notes. Individual notes can be attached to a particular notebook, but this approach fails because the search system is broken. Search occasionally displays results from EVERY note instead of only a specified notebook. I don't want to find word colleagues' information mixed in with my personal notes, but Evernote thinks it's OK. At the moment it is almost unusable for people with multiple projects all happening at the same time. Tags are useless. Nobody in their right mind mixes all their client notes with their personal notes in filing cabinets, so why does Evernote assume it's acceptable? For consulting jobs it would be nice to be able to separate each client into their own folder so there is no accidental overlap, but this is not possible with Evernote, so it remains a gimmick for me. I'm slowly training myself to use OneNote because Evernote is becoming unusable due to the unresolved bugs."
6,com.evernote,236.0974025974026,2,15,"It's so so.  I used Evernote with Lecturenotes. And while it was useful  to have all my notes and recordings at my fingertip in all devices (premium), there are many limitations. First the app doesn't sync with Lecturenotes so I have to upload the notebook and wait for it to finish uploading to choose its location otherwise it'd upload to the same notebook. Then I have to delete the old version of the notebook if I made any change, but I it doesn't automatically update for me. The notebooks aren't color-coded and I wish they appeare in tabs like in OneNote. There is no options to view the pages other than scrolling vertically. The recordings are at the end of the page so I have to scroll forever in big notebook. The handwriting is a huge pain, pdf notation is quite confusing and doesn't work on my tablet or phone. It takes forever to load the notebook too and the so called in text search function only works 1/3 of the time. I'm having the premium right now but it doesn't seem to worth the money so maybe I'll end it next year, unless there is a major improvement."
7,com.evernote,231.9805194805195,1,1,"2015 Update - Evernote has officially jumped the shark by removing key offline functionality for free users. You used to be able to view all notebooks (but not update them) while working offline. Then they restricted it so that you could only view notes that did not contain images. Now, you cannot even view basic, text-only notes - nor is there an option to save a note for viewing offline unless you upgrade. Evernote is now useless when data is not available: during oversees travel, as a frequent flyer, subway commutes, urban/underground settings (office, gym, shopping, etc).  In this day and age of FREE, full functionality organizational apps like OneNote (font changes, sketching capabilities, email to app, etc), I don't see a reason to continue using Evernote. Sadly after 3+ years of steady usage, I've barely touched Evernote in the past few months. As of today, I am transferring all of my data to OneNote where I can access my content at ALL times."
8,com.evernote,216.62987012987014,1,1,"I paid for the Evernote Plus to get the extra functionality on web and widget, and since the last update I regret this.    Went from 5 to 3: The only thing better in the new widget, is the letter size for me. It is now impossible to use saved searches in the widget, and that was what made it so useful. The  app itself works nice and does what it should. But without the saved searches in the widget the whole thing is not half as handy as it used to be.  So for me the whole new widget collection became pretty useless.    NEW EDIT:Went from 3 to 1: since the new update, I get at least 2-3 times the message that my widget list could not be loaded, and that it has to do something with my wifi. All other apps work fine. The previous widget worked fine. This last update really really ruined the whole Evernote experience for me, to the extent that the widget is now completely useless, frustrating me and messing up my workflow on Evernote."
9,com.evernote,214.62987012987014,3,0,"The interface has a few glaring violations of the ""rule of least surprise"". The worst is when I'm editing an existing note and tap the back button to return to the note list. It presents a dialog asking if I'm sure I want to proceed without saving the changes, and I'm given two choices: ""OK"", which will discard the changes, and ""Cancel"", which will return to the note. There's no option to save here, and the *affirmative* choice *deletes* my edits (jeez, if you're not paying attention...). Other apps either automatically save (which I would prefer in Evernote, and it does this for *new* notes), or ask if I want to save--not discard--the changes. Nope, in Evernote I have to reach up to the top left corner of the screen and tap the checkmark to save. Another annoyance is having to tap the edit button and then tap the text to edit a note. In other apps, simply tapping the text is sufficient to bring up the keyboard. A smaller issue is the left sidebar is essentially useless, since I can't actually navigate the notebook hierarchy from it--I have to choose ""Notebooks"" to get the same fullscreen list I get by just hitting the back button."
10,com.evernote,205.3961038961039,2,3,"I will miss you Springpad!! One of the main features I expected when I signed up for Evernote was to be able to allow my husband access to edit and share my notebooks and to be able to clip webpages. It seems ridiculous to have to pay per month for features that should be standard especially among members of the same household. Just say you are not a free service instead of looping people in to create notebooks that they can't do anything with.  AND If I wanted to save links, I could use bookmarks in my browser. I can't understand why web clipping is a separate app. What makes it worse is it's not available for tablets. I had to find a third party app. Can't delete notebooks from tablet. Can't hide completed tasks. Have to pay to edit offline. Evernote seems better served to desktop use, anyway. Doesn't help me when I prefer not to be stuck at my desk. I feel bad for all the loyal Evernote users that will probably have to upgrade to keep the features they use to have for free."
11,com.evernote,204.3961038961039,3,5,"I swapped to Evernote from Onenote after switching to a Chromebook and being thoroughly dissappointed with Microsoft's android application. That being said, this app has much better support for Andoird however the support for Chromebook is so-so. The app relies on your device's keyboard autocorrect features, which is great....for phones. My chromebook has a physical keyboard and thus doesn't have autocorrect built in. It is annoying to be reading through my notes and having to also spell check everything at the same time. The drawing feature is basic, but okay. After clicking the drawing icon it opens up a new page for your drawings, and once finished will simply ""paste"" the entire large picture under your notes. It would be nice if I could just annotate my notes and draw small diagrams next to, or between, paragraphs of text notes. I assume this is related to the lack of Chromebook support as that would be difficult to accomplish on a phone. You have the ability to add in photos from your gallery or dowloads into notes, which is awesome in addition to my Chromebooks ""snippet"" feature, however you can NOT resize the image from within the app. You must open the image seperately, edit the sizing of the photo (guessing on how it will fit in your notes) and then REIMPORT the image to the notes. This is annoying and frustrating. All in all, this app is not bad and gets the job I need done better than Microsoft (on android) but lacks support for Chromebook. Improve Chromebook support and I will happily raise my rating of this app."
12,com.evernote,194.16233766233768,3,25,"I have been using evernote since years, those new premium limitations is not to my liking but I understand that income is necessary. However there are several big flaws or missing features that hinder me from making it 5 stars. One is the ability to overview my whole note like a text file without edit tools. I mean that I just want a /read only/ feature. So you can read your whole text without being able to edit it. It is so easy to accidently tap on the screen and the keyboard appears. Then by mistakes it edits a single character and my list of newly edited notes is wrong. It would be nice also to have a shortcut to copy the entire text without having to go to edition mode. This is my number one problem that makes me lose a lot of time and sometimes by doing this it accidentally edits my text so I need to fix it. I often type on my computer so I can after that send the text on my phone, since writing on computer is faster and easier. Which is why. Third is to be able to manage fonts in app. This feature would make evernote the best around, I have not yet seen an app do that. Perfect if it has a dark mode, I quite dislike bright white background. Bravo evernote for making life so much simpler and easier :)"
13,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,187.54545454545453,2,2,"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise  especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I  understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad  impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service  that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's  also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so  much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy)  gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you  can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not  much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe  through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with  gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I  shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability  to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class  whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a  grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a  freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is  locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a  whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy."
14,com.evernote,184.92857142857144,2,4,"I love the potential of Evernote and its cross functionality with other apps / services thanks to IFTTT,  but what used to be quite a streamlined,  smooth and fast app is feeling bloated and clunky. Using it for anything but the simplest is not fluid nor simple,  it's beginning to feel like a chore. It's usability is also clunky.    I'll give one example and it's my biggest issue to date.  It's what prompted me to write this and re-rate the app.   I use a lot of checklists and I am constantly adding and removing lines as well as checking things off. Evernote always handles moving through the note in the most frustrating waiting way possible. If I add a line,  the text cursor is there.  If I scroll elsewhere in the list and tick or uptick an option it does so,  but then focus returns back to where the cursor was and I have to scroll all the way back.  It does this same focus shift when I want to edit a different line of text. I tap there,  I see the cursor flash so I start typing,  but the cursor didn't actually move and again focus is whipped back to my previous edit! It's very frustrating."

16,com.evernote,183.64935064935065,2,6,"Extremely laggy with long notes, almost unusable. Many people have this problem apparently, as I've been searching online for a way to fix this to no avail. Also, if you have multiple pictures in one note, good luck opening a particular picture when you're browsing through your note. No matter which picture you click on, it opens the first picture you ever attached to your note and gives you the option to just scroll through all the pictures you've uploaded to that note.   As a paying, premium user, it is surprisingly impossible to reach support through the app or browser. I tried to send them an email, and got an automated reply saying you have to post your questions or complaints on the Evernote forums. Really? I'm paying a yearly subscription, and I can't reach customer support? Really??  You'd assume such a massively popular and old app that gets frequent updates would have had bugs like these fixed years ago...  I'm currently starting a Google search for other reliable note taking apps.  Edit: Last update has drastically fixed the lag issue with long notes. I'm not sure if they fixed it on purpose or by mistake, but I'm not going to take any chances updating the app again after this in case the next update brings back the lag again."
17,com.evernote,183.3701298701299,1,129,"the new ""upgrade"" is a joke. If you are looking for note taking app DO NOT USE THIS UNTIL THEY GET IT FIXED. I used to love this and it worked really well for me. I gladly paid for the premium upgrade. I was able to save and print notes as PDF's. their spell check was never great but at least you could add a word and if you were lucky it would remember it. Now even basic words are shown as misspelled and there is no option to add a word to the dictionary I can no longer print individual pages, it is either all or nothing and that leads to a huge waste of paper. I have several notes as check-lists and tried to edit one today on my PC and it did not format properly to match my existing note.

It requires a constant internet connection, which I - and millions of other people on this planet - don't have. I used to be able to work on notes whether I was online or offline - a helpful little red exclamation symbol would appear on the sync item when the app couldn't sync because the internet was down, so I would be careful not to change to working on the same note on a different device. Now the app insists on me reloading the note when the internet is down and wipes out my latest edits. This is useless! I don't want to have to remove the sync setting as I do want the app to sync regularly when I'm online. If this continues to be a problem I will, finally, have to relinquish my subscription and migrate to a different tool.

Web clippings now have the hyperlink hidden in the information icon, which means more clicking to get back to the original article.  Which brings me to the new changes with the web interface.  The URL is also hidden in the ""information"" icon, and its not a hyperlink that can be clicked.  You have to copy and paste into the address bar of a new browser tab.  :-(    Also the layout of the web interface now has no view of snippets of notes, unless you click on the notebook icon.

If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did."

But if I roll the note to it's end the circle disappear, so I need to roll in up a little bit once again. Why?! Why reinvent the wheel? You have a H-U-G-E bar at the top of the screen. Just push all control and navigation there, without useless animations. Please.   2. Typing while note editing - When you editing a note, some other circle appear at the right-bottom corner of the screen, above the keyboard, exactly at the same place where the text ends. so instead of placing the cursor an the end of my text, I'm pressing this circle (with ""A""). I use it on Note 3, so it's not like I has a tiny screen. Once again: the H_U_G_E bar at the top of the screen can successfully contain this control.

Then I discovered I could access them on the web from my PC and that was wonderful. Then I bought a tablet and it immediately picked up all my notes and life was perfect, as it happily synched all three devices (phone, tablet and PC). Then I changed my phone and it all went horribly wrong. It hadn't occurred to me to log out of the account on my old phone before doing a factory reset, so when I tried to synch the new one, Evernote saw it as a fourth device. I either had to upgrade to the premium package at £45/y or disable not one but TWO devices. I was able to disable the old phone's account but that was not enough. I now have to live without it being on one of my devices, which is a right pain. Evernote is unquestionably good but it's not worth £45/y so I'm not upgrading.

However, there are some problems that make MS To Do awkward to use. 1. You can share lists and assign tasks. This would work a million times better if I could select multiple tasks and assign them to someone, instead of tapping through 3 different views for each task, one by one, and if I could assign someone while I'm adding a new task. Web version is also missing ""assign to"" in the context menu. 2. When setting reminders, it's really not that convenient to click through a ""shortcut"" menu, when I can never use the times listed in the ""shortcuts"". Not everyone's day begins at 09:00 local time. Can you just let me always skip directly to the date & time picker on both due dates and reminders, so that I don't have to second guess every tap? 3. It's cool that we can have themed lists, but the feature is next to useless when I can't set a default theme for all lists at once. I have 20 lists, not counting the weird default ""Tasks"" list. I'm not gonna go through every single one of them every time I want to change my list background or something."

33,com.microsoft.todos,168.0,1,53,"This last update hasn't been thought through enough before releasing. I came to Microsoft To Do from Wunderlist and the experience has not been great. From the outset when the Wunderlist importer didn't work I had a bad feeling about using this app. I use a todo list to organise my life so it's massively important to me and something I use many times every day. The ""My Day"" list is completely useless for my needs but there is no way to turn it off and it is stuck at the top of app just annoying the hell out of me every time I see it (this probably annoys me more than it should). The ""Today"", ""Week"" & ""All"" lists were my most used feature of Wunderlist. They were dynamic, smart and easy to use. After searching around in Microsoft To Do for someway to see all of my tasks sorted by planned date order I found the ""Planned"" list. Great! I can now see the tasks I've planned to do on different days all in one place. It's not the best but it'll do. The latest update has now made this list a massive ball-ache to use. Who's idea was it to add a filter! The list is already sorted by date this filter seems redundant (Is there no product team working on this app?), but what do I know maybe someone somewhere asked for it and a filter was added. Ok fine add the filter but don't make it mandatory! At the least add an ""All"" option! This is so frustrating to use now I can't see the overdue tasks unless I use the filter and then I can't see the planned tasks! Also, having to add tasks manually to ""My Day"" is crazy from a convenience point of view, I've already added a due date to the task! The ""My Day"" list needs an option to be able to hide it for those who don't use it. I've really tried with To Do for a couple of months now but I'm off to find another todo list service. Apologies for the rant but this has really upset my daily workflow."

There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit).

But, of course it's not as good. Only thing that I used Wunderlist for and how I planned to use To Do is one shared list for groceries shopping. First, I imported list from Wunderlist since it has active/unfinished items but couldn't get to have wife join the list after I shared it, so i had to create new list on my phone from To Do, move active items from imported list to this new list, share it and now it works. So, sharing imported list doesn't work. And most annoying is that shared list is not refreshed in widget after some action from another user until app is opened. Since this was the way we used list, through widget, and widgets are there so that we don't have to open app every time we want to do something with the app, if this is not fixed I don't see us using this anymore because I don't want to open app every time I get notification that something changed.

However, the longer I use it, the easier it fits into my routine.  My main likes:  - Syncs instantly with Microsoft To-Do on Windows 10.  - Provides a space to add notes.  - Can set a reminder.  - Has a sub-task feature called ""Step"".  - Has a ""My Day"" category which has potential.    Main issues:  - The Reminder/Snooze feature need mores work. The Snooze time seems to be broken. Can set 1 hour, but it still comes back in 5 min. Reminders create both To-Do app notifications and Windows 10 notifications. This gets annoying if you have more than one reminder set.    Wish list:  - I would like all unfinished tasks with the My Day flag to retain the May Day flag tomorrow. For me, this more closely matches how I used to roll-forward unfinished tasks on paper. It will save me extra steps each day.   - I would like to bulk-load Steps by cutting/pasting a list of steps from Excel or other external program - As an Office 365 user, I'd like to see more and better sharing/embedding integration between Office programs (e.g. Outlook 2016, OneNote, etc.) and the store apps like Microsoft To-Do."
42,com.evernote,163.1818181818182,2,1,"Poor implementation of a good idea I thought that the idea of being able to create notes and sync them between desktop and mobile phone was a great idea, as I find that working on my desktop PC for most things is much easier than doing the same on my phone.  However, I have discovered that the Browser implementation of Evernote is very buggy and frustrating to use.  I like the idea of being able to insert images into my notes, which Evernote allows, but the Browser version does not allow insertion of new images between existing ones.  Every image you try to insert will only go to the end of the note.  You literally have to delete the entire existing note and recreate it if you want to insert a new image.  Another bug exists when trying to change the font characteristics of any text you have already typed into the note.  The system will often not allow the change, and will keep reverting back to the old font style and size.  I have emailed their tech support about these problems, but have never received a reply or any help whatsoever.  Hopefully, it's because they are spending all of their time trying to solve these bugs.  In the meantime, I have decided to move on to another app, which so far is working much better."

For example, this Android version does not support the same (basic) formating of the desktop version, meaning I can not work solely on my tablet if I want to structure my note text in a way that makes it more meaningful and easier to read.  Or, to have your notes available off line, you have to select each note book, one at a time, make a few clicks to set it to keep it off line, and then you have to wait while that syncs because if you try the next, the dialog keeps popping away before you can use it, until the pervious one is synced.  This would be a bit OK, if you only had to do it once, but three times the ongoing sync stopped until I deleted everything, and then had to start all over.  And event this would be OK, if Evernote would listen and act on these annoyances, but instead they go on a develop new features for their new business ideas, and leave the chance for a great product lagging.

I feel as though the gamification aspect is tangential but foundational to the system design. If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side. The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them.

But I've had a problem the entire time I've used it. If I use evernote across all of my devices (the only reason I use it) it constantly happens that an older version of a note on one device will sync as the most recent version, even though that device hasn't been synced in days. I lose days of information. If I have it on my computer and I didn't close it out and my computer is in sleep mode for a weekend and I've been using it on my phone throughout the weekend and I return to the computer and wake it up, that version of the notes syncs up and screws me out of the entire weekend's worth of data and updates. What kind of idiot programming allows it to think a note that hasn't been updated in two days on one device should override a note that has been constant use on another device. And why hasn't this been issue been dealt with after lord knows how many years evernote has been going. If your data is important and you are a regular user. Look for something else. I am. I'm so fed up I could spit. While I'm at it. The formatting is a crazy person. I can change the formatting for the whole note and then I'll delete a line and the formatting for everything after that will revert back to a previous formatting. Sometimes I'll be making a list and every line will be a larger font. It's seriously like the damn thing is drunk. It doesn't matter what device I use. It has always been an idiosyncracy I put up with because I didn't want to have to find something better."

I used to just share and save it on Evernote. And I used to get exactly what was available on the site, exact view and same paragraph, same font, same line, same pic, etc. But now from last two updates Evernote has disappointed me again and again because whenever I share and save a note, it's(note's) view is totally compromised. No titles, no subtitles, no highlighted or important points or topics which are mentioned in site as it is. Everything is saved as just plain text. And in order to rearrange the note as it is on the site, I have to highlight what was already given on the website, which consumes my most of the time to organize the note! What happened guys? Already ""Simplify formatting"" feature was there. Now you have complicated the whole app for me.

I use Evernote pretty heavily, and it does what I need it to, but it also has a few annoying problems.  Syncing is at best every 5 minutes, so quite a few times I've finished a note on my laptop, shut down the laptop before it syncs, and then later on I can't find the note on my phone. You can tell Evernote to manually sync, but I really shouldn't have to remember.  Syncing not being instant can also lead to ""conflicting changes"" between notes, even in cases where it really wouldn't be hard to merge the changes.  The collaborative note stuff is also a bit silly in that one person editing the note ""locks"" the note so that no one else can edit it.  The rich text formatting also occasionally bugs out completely, especially on a note with lots of formatting, and sometimes the only way to fix it is to remove the formatting and add it all back manually.

It keeps overwriting stuff that I'm writing with something I've typed in the same note randomly.

It's really hard to get a good snapshot of your notes as a whole and how they're organized, or to move around between notes by navigating rather than searching. OneNote spoiled me. 2) SERIOUS issues with saving and autosaving. There's no warning message if you close a note without saving it, so it's really easy to lose your work. Same is true if a refresh or save fails for some reason: the message appears only briefly, so if you miss it you can keep plugging away at notes that you'll never be able to save.

148,com.evernote,134.03896103896105,3,2,"After multiple updated over the years, Evernote definitely is a lot more polished and feature rich than it used to be. But there are a few things that largely ruin the experience for me.  1. Not having off-line availability of notes in a free version. This feature is bread and butter of note taking. Not having notes available on demand, makes subscription almost a must, especially if used on non-mobile devices. There are other multi-platform note taking solutions available that offer this option free.  2. Continuous upsell of ""Upgrade you subscription"" type messages in push notification and in-app promos daily are starting to really bug me. Even with free accounts, getting bombarded with ads is not something a respectable service should do in such relentless way that can't be opted-out of. It definitely should be a big NO-NO for paid accounts of any level."

In Evernote it seems like it shows most recent notes when you open the app. They have a ""shortcuts"" feature however you have to go to the 3 line icon, click on ""shortcuts"" and then click on the note you want. That completely defeats the purpose of having a shortcut, you might as well go to the tag or notebook you want right away.

This had a date and time stamp which gave a history that helped to determine the pace of work on the task. It allowed the team leader to communicate easily and give feedback.

If you want to use Evernote for its high level features and are willing to pay for it, then you'll probably like it. However, don't expect a widget because they inexplicably removed it, to the disappointment of many of their users. And if you just want an app for quick note-taking with easily accessible and searchable notes, look elsewhere unless you plan to only use one device. The developers previously limited the basic (free) account to two devices. Fine, that's understandable, if not annoying. And you could still log in through a browser, but now a browser counts as a device, which is absurd. I assume a 1 device limitation is next. It's clearly an attempt to force people into the premium plan at $8/month, which is just too much for those of us that just want the features in the basic plan but with more than one device, and they continue to not offer a lower priced plan that many would probably adopt just to have more devices. For comparison, you can get a Microsoft 365 plan for $7/month, which gets you Office 365 and a TB of cloud storage.

You can create your primary notebook and then then child notebooks  under that, but you can't create 'grandchildren', 'great grandchildren' etc  levels of notebook which is a MASSIVE drawback for me and my wife.

And unlike other premium upgrades to note apps or music apps or photo apps, etc. that are a one-time $5 or $10, Evernote wants $5 A MONTH (but hey, pay for a whole year and it's only $45 for all you smart shoppers).  This is pretty nervy for an Android notetaking app that can't even insert freaking timestamps.  Maybe a fancy scratchpad with organizing features IS worth half the cost of a Netflix sub, but I can't justify it.  If you find built-in scratchpad apps inadequate and like a lot of what you see in Evernote, but really want local copies of notes and can't swallow Evernote's cost for that feature, check out Note Everything.  I've already moved back to it, and I'm going to happily pay the whopping $3.99 one time fee for upgrading to Pro.  Evernote functionality's good, but two stars for value."

This is simply because of Evernote aggressive approach to charging higher prices whilst removing free benefits we used to get. Apparently new people took over the company and now they are money hungry.  I understand that they need to fund it and have to charge but now the free version isn't even worth using. They should charge for extra features like social media and collaboration etc but to only give 60mb upload data per month is completely useless to me. All I use it for is to stay organised between my phone and laptop. Plenty of other free alternatives do this. Like Google Keep or Bear for IOS. So I'm really not going to pay for 1gb on the pro plan when I get 15gb free from Google.     Old review: When it comes to organisation this is software changed my life.   Amazing note taking system. Easy to upload and organise files & documents plus easy cloud access from laptop and phone.

The only widgets I got are a shortcut to a notebook and a string of icons for separate operations. And no way to enter EN from them. Makes my homescreen look like crap. Please, mabe a choice to customize a single bar? You guys said better widgets; where the hell are they? Big disappointment! 9/29/15 Hate the ""dot"" widgets. Need a toolbar. Seriously thinking of dumping EN; life will go on."
398,com.evernote,114.85064935064935,3,0,Great App so far I finally have all my lists and notes on one place! this is really awesome! What needs improvement is the formatting problem when I add some special Layout with the windows software and it's not compatible to edit in the android app (or just line by line...) One other point is that there is an old(?) widget and a new one within a separeted application.... why not just put the new widget inside of the app and delete the old one??...

The notes can be viewed but not edited. Reading the user forum this has been a problem at least since the beginning of the year."

It needs a custom Home location like a notebook or the most recent note to open upon launching. ""All Notes"" defeats the point if I'm supposed to use Evernote to organize. It needs a less cluttered list menu that automatically goes to Notebooks and offers the option of hiding Recent."
