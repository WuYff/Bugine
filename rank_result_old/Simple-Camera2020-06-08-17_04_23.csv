com.simplemobiletools.calendar,135.25,3,9,"Another app from Simple Mobile Tools without ads or internet permission. I really want to like this app, I love the fact that it is separate from the android calendar, potentially improving privacy, but can sync with it using Caldav if required. I would like to use it stand-alone, but currently there are too many quirks for it to replace my set up using 'Offline Calendar' & 'Calendar Widget', ⚫Issues include: ▪display of selection buttons when not using default orange. ▪Notifications disappear if the event is opened. ▪Notifications are not updated as time passes, still say ""tomorrow"" when event is today if reminder set for previous day. ⚫Wishes: ▪option to change the date format everywhere from 'month/day' to 'day/month'. In 'Event List' & Widget: ▪option to blank the text ""All-day"" (often events without times are not all-day events), ▪option to remove the 2nd line of entry ('to time' & 'description'), ▪option for an entry to appear every day for events lasting > 1 day. ⚫EDIT Since Aug there have been several fixes, particularly to handling of Caldav calendars, and thanks for the larger event colour tags."

com.simplemobiletools.gallery,89.25,3,9,"There's a bug in the app which doesn't allow to set photos as my wallpaper. I'm using the Poco F1 and I'm on MIUI 10.3.7 if that helps. Apart from that, no other issues. I especially love the ""show folders content"" option. If you could tweak the setting to make it look more like a timeline view that'd be great. Also an option for a side menu ? Easy access to folders, recycle bin etc. Since when I use the ""show folders content"", I lose access to the recycle bin."

com.simplemobiletools.gallery,80.0,1,0,"I've loved this app. It has been my replacement for quickpic. But with the recent update hid ALL the files in my sd card. I was just trying to hide  few folders. Idk what to do.   UPDATE AFTER THE DEV'S REPLY: still nothing. It doesn't show any of my files on music apps or the stock gallery. Only in the file explorer.    The way this mess started was by me selecting multiple folders and trying to exclude them, as it didn't work, i tried to hide them. Suddenly it gave me several ''unknown error'' bubbles and as i reopened it, it only showed the internal memory files. Nothing on my sd card is visible. I have very vital files in it, so i need a solution. Please.   I think it's necessary for me to mention that i uninstalled and reinstalled the app, i also deleted several nomedia files in hopes it would fix my problem, but it didnt.  Now that i reinstalled it, if i use the ''temporarily show hidden files1' option it does show me my pictures. But it does not restore my media in general. I cannot listen to my music or audio files in any player, only directly from the file explorers.   Finally, i tried what you said in your reply, but the problem is the apo hid files i didn't even hide, so it doesn't even show me an ''unhide'' option for most of them.   Please i expect a quick reply. Thanks in advance.   Second update:files are finally appearing after trying twice more. Will this be a permanent solution?  Can i safely exclude fiolders withtout my files being hidden by .nomedia files again?"
com.simplemobiletools.gallery,78.75,2,119,Horrible. You can sit there and delete files that you don't need anymore and it will show that it has been trashed but when you reopen the app the files don't go away. They are still there. What this does is jam up my phone with useless files and slows down my phone without even knowing that the video / picture files have never been deleted. On top of that you have to deal with ads on a gallery app... SMH Uninstalling and looking for a more useful app.

com.simplemobiletools.calendar,69.25,2,1,Custom repeat function seems to be bugged. Created several 16 week repeat events for work and some of them will create a second instance of the event then repeat both for the cycle period entered.

org.mariotaku.twidere,62.0735294117647,3,1,Good for browsing and doing everything else it even has a little notification bar over to tell you when your uploads are done & how long it'll be but it suffers problems there as this day & age people are recording in HQ up to 4-8k on mobiles super HD and right now it is uploading but it can't pass a 140mb file at a resolution of 720p its also missing the security settings but guess that's understandable in away. Its a pretty good app as it runs videos very smoothly but when posting yourself it can be bad I've stacked up a few items and it discarded all but one. Its a lovely display you can even mark tweets as sensitive it has the up to become one over on the Twitter app but unfortunately am having to keep the two & chrome :-( nice experience however it just needs a few more pushes...

It does not display anything and keeps showing me this message: 'No media files have been found with selected filter.' I tried changing filters, but, nothing happened. When I tried other gallery apps, I could see all my media. Then why is this app all of a sudden giving me problems??"
com.simplemobiletools.gallery,62.0,1,52,This is an ok photo app but it keeps popping up in my update list with a note saying it is no longer being maintained so please buy the premium version.

com.simplemobiletools.gallery,61.25,3,21,"It's good, especially because there are no ads, but it's complicated and irritating to use sometimes. When I tried to create a new photo folder it took me to something called root??? And then said an unknown error occured. I've figured out that if I click ON a photo folder, you can create a new folder easily from there, but that it's set up like that shows my point that it's not very simple and easy to use"

Whenever I opened the app it keeps on loading and doesn't loads up .I don't know why this is happening but i know this is only the gallery app which I can trust after the google photos and also it doesn't contains adds and bloatware . Over all it is great gallery app but i just Uninstalled it because it was not showing all the pictures. Looking for favourable reply.
com.simplemobiletools.gallery,60.75,3,7,"It's a nice, plain gallery app, but I've got one issue. Image quality. Normally, my pictures appear blurry when zoomed in, even if they're extremely high res (greater than 5000x5000). If I check ""Enable Deep Zoom Images"" to allow them to render in a higher resolution, they're no longer blurry, but now they're covered in severe color banding. I like how no-frills the app is, but until image quality is on par with other apps like QuickPic or Google Photos, I can't use it."
com.simplemobiletools.calendar,60.0,1,48,I like this app a lot. I use it literally 5+ times a day. Today 18th December it tells me for the first time that its been discontinued and I now have to pay. This upgrade was apparently free for one week in November but no notification until today. Seriously unimpressed. I'll probably pay up as otherwise I lose sh*tloads of events but this feels like blackmail to me.
com.simplemobiletools.gallery,58.25,3,1,Can you add color to the text when you show hidden items to easily identify and add a category for videos lastly can u able to drag pinned folders so that it is not alphabetical any more. Thank you.... I really like this app
com.simplemobiletools.calendar,57.75,3,27,"This would be a five star app but there is one major drawback; notifications for all day events cannot be set after the start of the event. For example birthdays are all day events. Google calendar allows a reminder to be set, say at 9am the day of a birthday, Simple Calendar doesn't. I like the reminders to be the morning of a birthday to remind me to send a birthday greeting, not the day or evening before. Simple calendar only allows reminders to be set before the event."
com.simplemobiletools.calendar,57.75,3,3,I loved this simple and useful app until it started repeating appointments that were not supposed to repeat forcing me to delete these unwanted appointments every day before getting a real view of what was in store for me that day. For example...tasks that I put to repeat on Monday and Wednesday would repeat every day of the week no matter how many times I deleted and redid it.
com.simplemobiletools.gallery,57.75,3,19,"Good Potential but my first use was to MOVE 4 folders to another folder. To my surprise the folders were lost although all of the content moved. Worse, the date-time stamps were modified so that original dates became ""today"" so I cannot use grouping to re-establish the folders. Immediate problems... 1) folders should have been retained for the move and 2) file dates should not be modified. (options were set to retain dates)"
com.simplemobiletools.gallery,57.25,3,1,"I've used this gallery for a year, and it's always worked perfectly... Until today, that is. I tried to delete a set of 12 photos from the camera folder, but instead it deleted the entire folder. I had recycle bin turned off, because I normally don't delete items unless I really want to, so I'll admit this part's my mistake. But for some reason, in addition to deleting off my phone, EVERY PHOTO I HAVE EVER TAKEN was removed from my Google photos as well -- and completely skipped the trash can there, too. So thanks, Simple Mobile Tools, for making a minefield of a gallery app."

com.simplemobiletools.gallery,55.75,3,15,"It's a great alternative to a very popular gallery app. However, I have some suggestions: 1. Allow pictures to display in their original size (not fit to screen). So if, for example, the image is 400x400 pixels, allow it to be displayed using 400x400 pixels on the screen. If the photo is 2000x2000, then please allow the app to display it at the screen's resolution, even if it zooms in a little already. 2. In landscape mode, double tap doesn't zoom in. 3.

If I try sooner, heavy glitches start to happen when I try to swipe to see the next images. I had high hopes for today's update (Aug 2018). Also an option to open the app in a specified folder is a must. A paid app with similar (and more) settings is much more smooth. I'd pay a couple or three bucks for bug-free version of this app anyway. But I'm tired of searching for the best gallery app (or waiting for the bug free one) and will buy the other one, I'm sorry.

org.mariotaku.twidere,49.25,3,5,"Description needs to be changed. Claims no ads, but putting those 'premium features' for free (promotions reward) requires ads, therefore that description is misleading. At least there's an opt-out option. This is/was open source, and when I first downloaded a year ago it didn't contain ads, but about a month ago they now offer us to have the premium features for free, but to do so it requires ads (unless you're willing to pay to remove them). Honestly, though, I don't feel I need these features, and given the choice to opt out, if you don't need them, don't opt in as that will bring you ads, which is contrary to its original mission of a Twitter client without ads. I don't know if I can trust them. I mean, what are they thinking!? Also, with that update, that app is actually slower than it is before!!!  Again, I'm still using it since I can't think of another Twitter app that is as open-source, free and with truly no ads because putting the 'promotions reward' (for the additional features) upset me because that's going to bring ads. But then again, if there's no need for these features like me, don't accept the promotions reward and you'll still have an ad-free Twidere.  Star deduction overview -1 for the 'promotions reward' that adds features for free at the expense of ads, which is contrary to Twidere's developer's promise of 'no ads' (questioning can any developer be trusted?) -1 for worse performance than before 'promotions reward' and associated ads were added to the app code"

The overall app is worthy of a 4.5+ if it weren't for the search function. Absolutely terrible results. If this were better I would give the app 5 stars but search is to important to overlook.

com.simplemobiletools.calendar,29.25,3,1,Calendar seems to work fine but there is a big problem with the Add Holidays part. I've accidentally added holidays from the very strange list in a language I don't recognise and there appears to be no way to remove it. Even if i did my country (NZ) is not even in the list. I can assure you we do exist. There are some names which are not countries and this aspect is a bit of a mess otherwise it does the job with no trace of ads so far.
com.simplemobiletools.gallery,29.25,1,1,This app worked well and was very nice until the recent automatic update deleted all the photos from my camera.

com.simplemobiletools.gallery,29.0,1,0,Not my thing. This app needs to work like an explorer. It needs to show a lot more details at first glance and sorting should have explorer mode. Currently it is a nightmare managing folders.....it could be a lot easier. Uninstalling.

I also don't like how it doesn't automatically refresh (even though I have the option ON) and I have to refresh manually. Overall, an OK app, would be great if they improve some parts."
