You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white."
org.wordpress.android,147.59638554216866,1,0,"Just hate it... Not intuitive enough, I made couple of ""mistakes"" that got me headaches. First one, I started a post, and I wanted to save it, so I pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options, but that icon is a ""paper airplane"" that publish the post without even ask! Alright, first use... I search for something like post adjustments (oh, they were in the footer!), and changed the post to local draft. But it NEVER went to draft again in the blog!. Worst than that, I continued editing it, and the next time I accessed it, a message appeared, something like ""the post is not updated, do you want to?"" and I thought of course, upload the changes, but what it did was download the first draft (the published one) overwriting the last one so I completely lost ALL of my work. ""Well, let's see the revisions..."" but there's NOTHING like that. On top of all that, I searched the internet for help, and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this, and search some hidden directories, but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesn't even know what is to root an android device. ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!"

org.wordpress.android,136.21084337349396,2,4,"It's worse sorry Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post. I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are. I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible.  I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.  Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter.  Please switch back to the normal way of adding images. Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update."

org.wordpress.android,131.26807228915663,3,11,"Useful but to be improved. 1) it's missing a search field.  2) no multi select and upload of multiple images from a single folder, it's either messy all together or one by one. 3) I lost the whole text and images of a new post because of an internet connection error, this should not happen no matter how bad the connection is, offline editing is what users expect from an application vs the web-admin! 4) post settings button is hidden when keyboard is open 5) can't edit site url 6) can't batch upload local charges"
org.wordpress.android,128.49096385542168,1,1,"What happened to the full editor??!!! Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird, useless version of what it was before. I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent, center, size/place images, etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone. Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor. As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog. Makes editing virtually impossible. - - - I received an automated response to this review which said, ""You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option. However, some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor, either."" - - - Found the setting. That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all. And, previously, before this change, the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features."
org.wordpress.android,125.96385542168674,1,0,"Ugh. Every 'update' frustrates me to no end. I have things working as they should... then an update like the latest wrecks everything.  Content in limbo. Endless upload errors. Takes forever to post. And... ugh... what happened to my custom image resize controll'? Once upon a time this app worked beautifully and did what it should... you see... people posting from their phones are ON THE GO! I just want to post quickly with no hassle- the control needed but not clutter. Many times its mobile data, in a remote location. The app used to be lean and mean and do the job perfectly. Now its like it's a mini desktop app that's bogged down with junk. What used to take seconds... select some pics on phone ... share to WP app... add text hit upload and DONE... is now futz with this and that ... fight the awful quirks ...hit post and wait wait wait...error. error.

org.wordpress.android,125.32530120481928,3,10,"Not as integrative as I would hope Three things plague this app for me. 1-You cannot upload on the featured image button, you have to do that on the main screen of the site. 2-You cannot get the edit post link through the app, have to log into dashboard on a browser. I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello. 3-There is no word count visible. I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count. All three of these would make this a five star app for me, else it is useless for me and I might as well just write through the browser."

org.wordpress.android,115.96686746987952,1,1,"Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor. This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images. It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor. Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started. Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface. I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible."
org.wordpress.android,115.855421686747,3,4,Introduces one to a world of interesting people. I like the app but wonder sometimes why WordPress suggests that I share posts on social media to increase views when I have done so to several sites the day before and had multiple comments and likes on those sites but WP shows me having less than one-third as many views or worse. People follow my blog or like a specific post but somehow there are no views that day. The notifications are useful but sometimes seem inaccurate.

org.wordpress.android,107.46987951807228,2,12,"The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update. The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access. It was always the first thing I looked at whenever I opened up the app.     I maintain several WP sites for myself, both business and personal. I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.    I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change. I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.  Otherwise, at least in my opinion, they've partially crippled the app."

There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first.

They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet.   Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled.  One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions.  rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible.  There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.  being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.   Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch.  Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side.  I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of ""you shouldn't be doing that"".  However other applications I use do have panels that pull down or pull in from the side.    ... out of space ..."

com.habitrpg.android.habitica,89.43373493975903,2,0,"Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed. If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did."

I uninstalled imediately after the second push ad. Push ads are unacceptable in any form.  I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature. DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background. There are better ways to let users know of features. For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched.

Export seems OK and the transactions are deleted as desired, but importing the QIF into the desktop software reveals problems. The Note field is not included in the QIF, the date format is apparently too ambiguous sometimes and prompts for a fix that is not always usable (breaks the import), and the import sequence is a long and too-interactive wizard.

There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because, in this app, an administrator can ""Reply"" to comment that is pending moderation, but in the regular WP Admin interface, the button is labeled ""Approve and Reply"" not just ""Reply.""

When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was. When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away.  In my opinion, the application completely failed the test. If I were in an unfamiliar city, (which is the point of a mapping application), I need to find the nearest gas station, ATM, pharmacy, or a specific address.

It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers).  There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though. Primarily this is just in not having locations. For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by.  Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours).  It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.  Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters.  Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are)."

I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on..."

This is a serious deficiency and rules it out as a useful tool for me. It couldn't even find the city I live in, and I was literally 2 miles from it. 2) Routing is SLOW. This makes my decade old tomtom seem speedy. 3) Route time is WILDLY inaccurate. Over 7 hrs to drive 200 miles by highway? YGBSM 4) No apparent way to get an alternate route. I couldn't even find any way to force it to go through a waypoint. (Another deal breaker for me.) 5) Since routing time is so inaccurate and lack of alternative routes, no clue whether the actual route it picks is anywhere near reasonable.   The good: 1) Really nice maps. The best I've seen. 2) Useful info on POIs including hours, phone, website, etc. is great. 3) Can use national level overview maps with cities and interstates without any download.  This would be good if all you want is pretty maps with no routing. I may keep it just so I can see where in the world I am while flying."

The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point.

However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat.  Two fixes, having 3 stops is ok if I can chain routes, as in save them and load them quickly; or allowing to add up to 10+ stops, the average that you need on 80+km rides on these forest mazes.  Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to."

Amusing on the autobahn, but a real pain when driving slowly or walking in a city center or small village. Gives very short notice for lane changes/exits. And unlike Google Maps which will say ""slight right"" or ""use right lane,"" this app tends to say only ""turn right!"" Which, again, is confusing. If you can use it, Google Maps is way better.

Once this was a great app. Why break something that once worked so well. I have thousands of people on my site every day. This app is awful.
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,56.99698795180723,3,101,This app is very good if you need a map while not connected to the web. This app has a long way to go. Update: I have had this app for sometime now and they have done a good job making it better. I find myself using it more often than when I first purchased it. I would go 3 1/2 stars if I could.
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,56.91265060240964,2,27,"I used to swear by Habitica for a long time, but frankly I find it almost unusable. The biggest, most important problem is the way sync works. You can't use Habitica if offline (or have bad internet connection), you can't click several buttons in quick succession, and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server, Android widgets are absolutely unusable. Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour. If every time I try to register a Habit or a Daily I must worry about Habitica not syncing properly, then it robs me of time and mental energy. Which makes it useless for actually instilling habits."
org.wordpress.android,56.90060240963855,2,1,"More frustrating than useful, non-user friendly, glitchy Can't see anything on the page where you type your blog on the app, with the keypad obscuring everything even when I'm not typing. Today (which was also only the second time), when I posted on my blog, WP wouldn't let me reposition images inside the article after adding descriptions to them, both on the app and the website and I had to add an additional note at the beginning of my article explaining the images, compromising its structure. I'm new to WP and intend to write more, so please fix these asap."

I would like to suggest that their will be a ""search button"" so it can be easily find the certain topics or writings without keep on scrolling and scrolling. :) I am looking forward for this soon.  Thanks a lot."

However the last time, I switched apps and came back to find that all that I had written had disappeared - not even a local draft was saved. Was very disappointed. Hope there's a feature that saves as you type or at least recovers what you've typed."

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,56.704819277108435,3,2,"Wow, what has happened to this app. It used to be so good and extremely user-friendly.  Even after downloading a number of maps it still can't find it's arse with it's own hand. Not impressed with the new version. I have increased my opinion by one star because the Maps Me guys responded to my problems and really made an effort to sort out my issues. I feel there are still issues to be fixed so will see if this can again be a 5 star app. One issue is if you select a landmark without a direct road access then try to get a routing it doesn't work.  You have to select a road outside the landmark, what?? Secondly when doing search for somewhere like Xi'an China if you forget the apostrophe Xian City  itself does not appear, just 300 hotels etc in Xian that spell it without the apostrophe. Minor bug but still a pain if you don't know the exact spelling. Will still use it, but before I never considered using anything else,  now will keep my eye out for something better. Doubt it but you never know."
org.wordpress.android,56.65060240963855,2,0,"Hi there, let me first tell you that I appreciate having this platform to share the gospel. But...this site has one drawback that makes wordpress a very poor choice for online discussions. Specifically, you can NOT delete or edit anything you say on someone else's site. (But the admin. of the site you commented on can delete or edit anything you say on their site). Had I realized this early on I wouldn't have used wordpress, but now I have so much data into wordpress that it's hard to leave."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,56.54216867469879,3,88,"Great tool but runs horribly on my phone at least - even after latest bug fix update. Super laggy to open keyboard on search, freezing and crashing often. Sometimes zoom buttons are missing or not in their usual screen location."
org.wordpress.android,56.51204819277108,1,0,since last update the app is crashing all the time even don't upload a media file always say something went wrong please try again. Normally a app work good after update but with WordPress no longer apply this rule. the app is crashing all the time you can't write a post or upload a photo for a video file. I am clear the catch. And also install and uninstall the app several times but the problem is going same.

I don't have any VPN and also I'm very close to the WIFI so no problem with that as well. As TN, India is my birth state and it is bad that I'm not able to download the map giving 1 star"
org.wordpress.android,56.40060240963855,3,3,"The 3-Star rating is for the app (not the platform). I love the WP platform but several aspects of the Android app need to be addressed and updated. First, customizing your site/theme on the app is nearly impossible. The app constantly redirects you to the desktop version and even then its inconsistent. Second, there's no way to edit Portfolio Projects within the app. A little annoying when trying to work on-the-go."

All of the location settings was on,as always,but for some reason, this app couldn't work. I found wifi nearby,downloaded other app that had offline Rome maps,and used that one.

The challenges are a joke (I saw one where your challenge was to join their group. How do you consider that a challenge?) I still haven't figured out what silver does or what benefit you get from marking a task as ""trivial,"" AND I'm unable to see how long it's been since I last checked off a task, so I might end up accidentally marking it twice.

org.wordpress.android,55.73493975903614,3,14,Id be happy with it but my ads do not appear as per my settings.
