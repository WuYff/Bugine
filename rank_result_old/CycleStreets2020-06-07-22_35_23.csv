org.thoughtcrime.securesms,182.27272727272728,1,656,"WHAT is the point of advertising ""private"" or ""secure communication"" if you are going to get into my contacts database and send me notifications that new users in my contacts have joined Signal?  I didn't ask for that information, the new users did not give their permission to share that information with me, and most importantly, I NEVER gave Signal permission to access my contacts.  Clearly Signal is NOT about protecting privacy.  Uninstalling."

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,91.44008264462809,3,197,"Even though I still use this as my main texting app, unfortunately I have to knock off 2 stars for a huge flaw that the developers refuse to see as an issue. If a user has Signal installed and then uninstalls it, but doesn't unregister their Signal account, your texts will be sent via Signal and your intended recipient won't receive them via their SMS app. There's not a way for you to really know they uninstalled unless they tell you and it needs to be made more apparent to the user when they uninstall that they also need to unregister their account. Luckily, if you know your texts are going to a black hole, you can hold the ""Send"" button and force it to go via unencrypted SMS. I had 2 people who thought I was ghosting them because of this engineering oversight. You can still receive their texts, but they can't receive yours, so it makes you think communication is all good. Other than this massive flaw it's a fantastic app. Love the UI and feature set, but if there's even the slightest chance that I can send texts to someone and have them not receive it, that needs to be addressed ASAP before I can recommend this to anyone else. I've seen many threads open on this same topic and it falls on deaf ears. Pleeease devs, realize it's a problem and take steps to fix it! Some potential solutions: 1. Make it clear to the user when they uninstall that they also need to unregister 2. If someone's messages come in unencrypted, obviously they uninstalled Signal. The app should prompt a warning that the user likely uninstalled and that they won't receive your texts if you try to send via Signal, and recommend switching to unencrypted SMS. That's just off the top of my head and I'm sure there's more elegant ways to solve it."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,88.15702479338843,1,0,"This app is used all the time and is nearly perfect. Really bad with media though.  Only one image at a time. Can't send video sizes that standard pixel app can but pixel is special like that though even note 5 couldn't send much of a video file. Can't send messages to people without having to show your phone number which would make it more stealth. Also if you set messages to dissapear after certain time frame if android to iPhone , the time will go back to not dissapearing when the other person replies if they haven't also set it the same or set it at all. Also shame that it doesn't let you choose a app icon and shows its a messenger app unless you use a entire icon pack or launcher like nova.  Pixel is best phone ever and is only phone I haven't rooted and I'd like the app icon to appear as a calculator icon but I then have to change my launcher which sucks.  For a stealth app we should have icon options for home screen.   HOWEVER apparently the SMS and calls are secure and not logged with telco and not able to be retrieved from phone once deleted and can't be listened into so thats awesome if it's legit.  I know for a fact that if you out spyware on a mobile and clone a phone without person knowing then you can NOT view signal app SMS like you can every other app but you can listen to phone calls if you have control over the other handset microphone which can't be helped.   It's a legit app.very good at the basic needs so long as what we are told about it not being logged or recorded is true.  I'd pay plenty for this app if I had to and was able to attach a file or multiple images.  Would be great if you could have an option to send a message in a image too. So anybody who finds your phone and opens app sees a picture but not the message unless they had a code to extract the message from the picture like another appointment I've seen.  That would be a great feature . Thanks for this app"
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,83.7417355371901,1,223,"If it's so privacy focussed, why can't it be installed without granting permissions to almost everything on the phone? Why can't I use this messaging app without granting access to my calendar, or body sensors, or my contacts? Some specific permissions are needed obviously (e.g. camera & storage if you want to take a photo and send it). But why my calendar or contacts? Must be data mining or would allow installation without these permissions. BBM don't do it. So, Signal app cannot be trusted."

Recent version seemed to be acting perversely, sending one to slip road to exit motorway only to rejoin it. Also no option for using motorway if available. Not good. Also it would be useful to be able to have waypoints and preferred routes and types of roads to avoid. Updated version now doesn't bring up saved favourites when planning route when tapping on To button. Another feature absent is any indication of the name of the road you are on, or, often, the junction numbers on motorways. The maps do not always show road names as well, or if they show up, the names will vanish when you zoom."

On my (android) phone, I get a pop up window when I first join or start a thread which lets me make my profile visible but once done, there is no way view that setting. If you have several threads, it's hard to remember if you did that and impossible to verify that you did it correctly. We all end up spending a good deal of our time asking each other if you can see see my name and telling each other to access settings that either don't exist or are practically impossible to find. I think it may be different for iphone users because some on the thread swear that it's available any time but I've spent well over an hour on my phone trying every possible icon to no avail. Other users who don't have that problem are annoyed that they can't see my profile probably think I'm just not able to figure it out. Please just make a simple button in settings for all users of both platforms to make the profile visible!"

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,74.52272727272728,1,1,"STOP! Using Signal as your SMS app traps you forever! I found this out when I switched devices: Any friends who've sent a Signal message can't send an SMS to that person anymore. Anyone who has to stop using Signal for any reason becomes unreachable & the devs labeled the problem ""won't fix"". Once someone texts you by Signal, Signal won't let them send an SMS anymore; there is no option, no fix. Signal messages sent to a former user go to a black hole. No failure message, no notice that it wasn't received; SMS messages come in & your responses go nowhere. In short, trying Signal with even a few friends FU¢<S YOU out of them ever being able to reach you by SMS ever again (unless they ALL quit using the app?). It's evil. DO NOT USE THIS APP FOR SMS! Ironically upbeat original review follows: Better than most messaging apps, has a nice Dark theme, & can also be your default SMS app, which is convenient (it's a trap! See warning at top). I don't like it telling everyone in my phone book that I'm on Signal. That's pretty invasive & should be optional. Encrypted Signal conversations seem to be stored only on each device, which is more secure, but means that if you reinstall or lose/break your phone, you lose all previous messages, irretrievably. Worse, there's no method to save just one conversation, just a raw .xml log of every message ever, with no encryption. A more secure way to back up individual conversations would put this app in 5-star territory. A Search to pick out certain words in my message history would be super handy too. So would Google Voice integration, or Google Hangouts, Google Allo, or Google Duo... Or get really wild & support WhatsApp messaging so we don't need both apps! Signal is not a decentralized messaging network, so it'll only work as long as Signal's servers are online, & encrypting the transmissions won't help if your phone (or your associate's phone) is hacked; Actual ""privacy"" may vary based upon your skills & how exposed you are in other ways. Don't blame the app if your device is insecure! Overall it's a very pleasant app to use. Making it my default SMS app means I never have to look at a phone's ugly default Messaging app (also means I'm trapped forever! See warning at top). If there's a better encrypted messaging app, I can't tell you about it. DO NOT USE FOR SMS, SEE WARNING AT TOP."

It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match. Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options.

Can anyone say, ""Backwards!"" Who's idea was it to make the text larger AFTER we send it, WHEN IT DOESN'T MATTER?! LOL. Does anyone read these reviews? Attempted to change 3 stars to 2 stars, because of latest downgrade. What makes ""smaller text"" part of a purported 'improvement', when the text was already too small?! Previous version (that didn't need fixing/breaking) displayed 2 checks to signify a text was received. Now, it's a circle with a check inside covering another circle, with a fragment of that circle visible. Why?? The 2 checks before was just fine & easier to see! * signifies improvements we're suggesting. * 2 checks please. Someone thought it a good idea to remove the color aqua/turquoise from color choices. Why?! Bring back what worked fine & stop wreaking the app. This is just what most app Undevelopers do to apps. They make changes, to show they're doing something, as if any changes made will be viewed as improvements. They are NOT improvements, hence the truth-telling above ""downgrade of the app"". We don't actually SEE any improvement in this version. Group chat, OK. We don't care about that. We'd like to SEE what we're writing. * And how about (as in native text app) as we wrote a text, let the window expand vertically, to more than 4 lines, so we don't have to scroll up & down just to see the first part of the sentence we're proof reading. We would have continued using older versions had we been given a choice. We save old APK files (installation files) of apps so we are NOT at the effect of these busybodies, the Undevelopers who ruin so many well functioning apps. It's as though the Undevs make changes, so as to look as though they're doing something & they are needed. In reading hundreds of reviews, we've discovered that many, many people are aware of this & at the effect of it, since they are NOT aware of how to save old APKs. Please stop wreaking Signal & manager, if there is one, please stop allowing these unnecessary downgrades of Signal to continue. * Please at least gives us the option to have larger text! * Again, let the window expand as we write... Although we appreciate the app & the idea, too often, a call doesn't connect & we have to restart app or even the phone. It's been like this for a looong time! On Android & iPoo. Have shared with many & many have same issue. Haven't noticed any improvement with this in 2 years. Video quality on calls not impressive. Sound quality sometimes OK. Good for sending files (sometimes). Wonder about any real privacy, since there's a mic in the phone? How does actual ""privacy"" happen in this situation? Signal is definitely worth having.

I love this app and use it, but I have to point out two seriously major flaws. The first: some vehicles send out an automated text via Bluetooth that says ""I'm driving."" when the user is operating a vehicle and receives a text. This feature does not work with this app. In fact it appears anything sending texts via Bluetooth does not work, so people that communicate hands free are out of luck. Next, if your WiFi strength is weak, the app can't send or receive texts which I think is dangerous. In fact the app doesn't even show me my contact names,  just phone numbers. Once I get better WiFi or sign off WiFi altogether,  it works correctly again.  They need to change it so if a message can't be sent in WiFi,  it falls back to cellular.

There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first.

A friend downloaded this app, for the purpose of privacy, and then once installing it, received a message from their abusive ex who had been notified when they joined the app. From my perspective, this violates the concept of privacy and needs to be something that the user has control over from the very beginning.

Changing the phone call button to default to the in call action is annoying, because I rarely have good service here, so I have yet to even complete a successful signal call. Latest update is great. Dropped a star for hassling me to invite every contact to signal.  Long story short, I'm extremely disappointed how far from their roots they have gone.

I have two major complaints: 1) starting new and finding past group messages is not intuitive. I'd usually want to start using the pencil button at the bottom, but could only add one recipient. Then I'd remember to go back to the top right button and start a new group message. It would then ask me to name the group, at which point I'd think, ""oh, maybe I already have this group saved"". Id then search for that group message for several minutes only to give up. 2) Reliability. I would guess maybe 25% of my photo, video of group messages would go through. Only some of the people on groups would get my messages. On individual messages, some of my pictures wouldn't go through. I wouldn't have realized they weren't if the recipients hadn't texted me back saying they got a blank message. The limit for video sizes is also difficult to work with."

This won't your daily messaging app. You get no usernames and you must send your phone number to the person you want to communicating which defeats the purpose of privacy. Stickers sucks, there are no custom themes, can't edit messages, can't export history making desktop version just useless without it. Chat is more than just words in a text box. This platform makes so much compromises and you get just encryption, which is great per se. But if I wanted encryption I just head to Telegram's own approach and get all the goodies with it. I may sound biased but apps just seems unpolished End-to-end encription is gimmicked throught the entirety of the app, just reminding you're safe.

If one of your signal contacts deletes signal without disabling their account you won't be able to message them and you won't know your messages aren't getting through so you'll think you're responding but the other person will never see your messages. Even if you know they deleted signal you cant default to sending them an SMS instead you'll have to do it manually. If you do decide to go back to sms make sure you disable your account!

This app's design reflects that. Signal forces you to use your phone number as your identity, which means you can't remain anonymous. It also doesn't stress the importance of lock PIN and contact key verification, which means hijacking a Signal account can be as easy as intercepting one SMS. Unless you use it correctly, all you get is a false sense of security."

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,52.23347107438016,2,1,"Signal was okay. At first off putting because its totally misleading that sends encrypted SMS. It invites you to set it as the default for SMS messages. It then defaults to sending online messages to any contacts who also have a Signal account EVEN IF BOTH YOU AND YOUR CONTACT IS OFF LINE at the time. It's possible to change this on contact at a time by long pressing the send button and switching to SMS. Then also go back manually later when your both online. This is not easy to discover. The app does not show if your contact is online or not. I used this for years, but quit when I realised the feature to export plain text messages from the app was silently removed. It's possible to move messages to a new phone, but not possible to sync two Signal databases. If you have two you must choose. This was a deal killer for me."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,52.15909090909091,3,1,"Difficult to tell when sending securely New color scheme makes it much more difficult to know you're sending/receiving securely at a glance. Sure,  the send button changes icons and you get the two check marks in the viewed message,  but it used to be so effortless to tell. Additionally,  if a text-secure using contact uninstalls the application,  you will continue to send encrypted messages that do not get received/processed. This requires manually setting insecure messaging each time app is opened,  which can remain insecure for other contacts."

Would like to see things like ""Fantasy Football League"" or ""Army Platoon"" in my inbox instead of a list of names that's cut off. 3. Pin conversations to top of inbox (for both Signal conversations and SMS/MMS) - please add this. 4. Any sort of customization of the look/feel AT ALL.

Number 2, if the media file fails to send there is no resend option, you have to physically go and search for that one specific item and resend it AGAIN, of which some of them failed to send more than three times.

Please, if a message doesn't send over data after a set timeout, or a Signal call fails, Signal should prompt to ask to try again in normal non-encrypted mode.  It's also more tedious to call people who don't use Signal, as the call doesn't begin automatically after pressing call if the other person is not on Signal, it just prefills their number. This difference in behaviour on the same UI is frustrating.  A different colour for each person is jarring: I would prefer one colour for secure and one colour for insecure communications.

It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers).  There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though. Primarily this is just in not having locations. For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by.  Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours).  It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.  Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters.  Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are)."

You can longpress to send insecure messages but the call button can't be changed.   The transport method also resets back to secure after changing it with longpress.  Sorry for the 1 star but this makes the app frustrating after at least one frequent contact removes signal.

I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature. DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background. There are better ways to let users know of features. For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched.

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,38.481404958677686,1,1,"Effectively useless for cycle routing. I downloaded this to get cycle routing which Google maps doesn't offer in Central America. Maps.Me does do cycle routing but it's effectively useless. First, it only offers you one route to your destination, so if you were thinking about taking another road, too bad, maps.me will not show you how long that road might be. You only get the one suggestion and no others, and no way to make it give you other options.  Second, there's clearly a compulsion by the app to avoid anything it thinks is a highway at all costs. So you end up with totally bizarre and out of the way routes when there's a direct road from you to your destination. This avoidance of highways would be ok if you were given more than one route to choose from, or you could turn off the 'avoid highways' preference. Unfortunately this is not possible. All of this might be fine in the US or Western Europe, but in Mexico and Central America if a road doesn't have a number (and is nominally a highway) it probably isn't paved. So avoiding anything with a number is basically going to be sending you along a lot of dirt roads. The app is also then also avoiding lots of rural highways, totally quiet, beautiful, no traffic, two lane roads.   Finally, they made a big deal with an update that made the app display an elevation profile for cycle routes too. This is a big deal for cyclists, as it's important to know the hills you have in front of you (or at least on the one route the app wants you to take). Sadly, this elevation profile is effectively useless too. The profile had nothing on it to show scale, so you have no idea how high the individual peaks are. There is one number given next to an up/down arrow symbol which I think must be net gain??? Or maybe it's total gain??  I really have no idea. And honestly, if you're going to give me one number, give me the highest altitude I'll reach on that route. From there I can guestimate the other climbs.  Maybe the app is ideal for driving. Maybe it works better for cyclists in cities. I don't know. I do know that it's pretty useless for me, except in the rare circumstances that the app and I are in agreement about which road to take."

Otherwise it gives error messages - but not until MINUTES after it appeared that all was well and actions have already been initiated - saying ""failed"". It gives no reasons. All other messaging apps work fine and everyone in my contacts is reachable, and can reach me. Not with Signal, though. It has decided that I am only allowed to communicate with ONE contact.... sometimes. Obviously something to do with tides, or something .... I went to multiple ""troubleshooting resources"" - including Signal - and I see so many complaints about error messages and failures to send or communicate with established contacts. I read and tried various proposed ""solutions"" but nothing worked. Before leaving this review (my first ever review; that's how bad this is), I spent a week trying to get Signal working but it's just way too unreliable for us to trust. If you're unemployed or retired and have the time or the inclination to try and get useless things to work, this problem-disguised-as-an-app might entertain you. On the other hand if you're a competent professional whose role requires reliable resources that facilitate immediate, clear communication from your colleagues and allies in the field then stay FAR away from this rubbish. You're better off yelling for help from a window, and crossing your fingers that someone hears you. That produces better results that expecting Signal to contact anyone for you! Good luck!"

While the app focuses heavily on security they lack privacy in a few ways:  1. The app requires me to add and maintain contacts by sharing access to my phonebook. Users phonebooks are uploaded to Signal. In addition, when  a user installs Signal, and grants contact access, it notifies all my ""friends"" that I'm on the platform.   2. When messages are set to expiring the app still allows a remote user to download and save attachments. There are competing products that do NOT allow this.

However, I found that full version severely flawed. While the program correctly identified my being at my home, and while it correctly identified the name of the street I was on, when I tried to search for my full address, including the house number, it could not find the address and suggested similarly named streets in other towns. When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was. When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away.  In my opinion, the application completely failed the test. If I were in an unfamiliar city, (which is the point of a mapping application), I need to find the nearest gas station, ATM, pharmacy, or a specific address. If I cannot rely on Maps with Me to do that, I have no use for it. I have requested cancellation of my purchase."

Worse, the developers seem rather complacent/indignant about suggestions.  For instance, I emailed them about integrating delayed-sending texts, like Gmail does with email, and they responded with zero interest and no explanation.  It's a very basic function that even the stock Messages has, so the fact that they are stuck thinking inside their own little box is a bit unnerving."

It will also do this thing where you are typing out a text but no text shows up. You won't realize it until you go to hit send which it can't because it shows that the text message is empty.

Additionally, sending private messages doesn't help when nobody uses it. Everyone I got to use it stopped because of the mms issue. I'm tired of never being able to get mms messages on the rare occasions someone sends me one, like the pictures of my God son I never got. Yeah thanks for that. If not fixed in next update, I'm Uninstalling. It's been an issue for a long time and plenty of opportunities to fix it."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,30.619834710743802,3,0,"I really wanted to like this, but I'm going to stop using it. Notifications are a big problem. I do get a notification in the status bar and notification panel, but the icon doesn't show a notification indicator unless I have more than one text. (For example, if I get 2 texts, the icon shows a 2 on it, but if I only have 1, there's no number.) I get a lot of notifications from various apps, so it's really easy for me to clear the notification panel without noticing that I received a text. I've missed quite a few texts that I didn't know I had until I opened the app to send one, or because I've gotten a new one. Unless the app is fixed to show a notification number on the icon, it's worthless to me."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,30.619834710743802,3,0,"This app is excellent for messaging, but mediocre for VOIP calls.  I tested encrypted VOIP calls between two Nexus 5 phones and found the call quality poor.  The sound was muffled and there was noticeable noise on the line that made having a conversation difficult.  Regular calls between the two phones sounded fine and clear.  For messaging, the app is an excellent replacement for other messaging apps, (having tried both the default and other third-party apps) even without the encryption, and the encryption is a nice bonus."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,30.619834710743802,3,0,"Signal does not preserve RedPhone as a phone Without RedPhone, you lose the ability to place secure calls from your dialer or car home, or to use voice commands to place the calls hands-free. (To do this, dial/save an * after your contact's number.) Essentially RedPhone has gone from being the cell call's replacement to being the voice feature confined to a messenger.  You will need to find the RedPhone 1.0.3 apk from another source to restore phone-like functionality."
