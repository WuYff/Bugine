com.habitrpg.android.habitica,82.36131386861314,1,2,"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on..."
org.wordpress.android,81.91605839416059,2,2,"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,75.53284671532847,2,0,"Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed. If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did."
org.wordpress.android,70.00729927007299,1,0,"Ugh. Every 'update' frustrates me to no end. I have things working as they should... then an update like the latest wrecks everything.  Content in limbo. Endless upload errors. Takes forever to post. And... ugh... what happened to my custom image resize controll'? Once upon a time this app worked beautifully and did what it should... you see... people posting from their phones are ON THE GO! I just want to post quickly with no hassle- the control needed but not clutter. Many times its mobile data, in a remote location. The app used to be lean and mean and do the job perfectly. Now its like it's a mini desktop app that's bogged down with junk. What used to take seconds... select some pics on phone ... share to WP app... add text hit upload and DONE... is now futz with this and that ... fight the awful quirks ...hit post and wait wait wait...error. error.  Wrangle things back to where they work again....then get blitzed by the next update"
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,67.54014598540147,2,0,"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus"
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,65.92153284671534,2,1,"In the latest version (downgrade of the app, forced upon users) the text we view while writing is now even smaller & after we send a text, the words are larger. Can anyone say, ""Backwards!"" Who's idea was it to make the text larger AFTER we send it, WHEN IT DOESN'T MATTER?! LOL. Does anyone read these reviews? Attempted to change 3 stars to 2 stars, because of latest downgrade. What makes ""smaller text"" part of a purported 'improvement', when the text was already too small?! Previous version (that didn't need fixing/breaking) displayed 2 checks to signify a text was received. Now, it's a circle with a check inside covering another circle, with a fragment of that circle visible. Why?? The 2 checks before was just fine & easier to see! * signifies improvements we're suggesting. * 2 checks please. Someone thought it a good idea to remove the color aqua/turquoise from color choices. Why?! Bring back what worked fine & stop wreaking the app. This is just what most app Undevelopers do to apps. They make changes, to show they're doing something, as if any changes made will be viewed as improvements. They are NOT improvements, hence the truth-telling above ""downgrade of the app"". We don't actually SEE any improvement in this version. Group chat, OK. We don't care about that. We'd like to SEE what we're writing. * And how about (as in native text app) as we wrote a text, let the window expand vertically, to more than 4 lines, so we don't have to scroll up & down just to see the first part of the sentence we're proof reading. We would have continued using older versions had we been given a choice. We save old APK files (installation files) of apps so we are NOT at the effect of these busybodies, the Undevelopers who ruin so many well functioning apps. It's as though the Undevs make changes, so as to look as though they're doing something & they are needed. In reading hundreds of reviews, we've discovered that many, many people are aware of this & at the effect of it, since they are NOT aware of how to save old APKs. Please stop wreaking Signal & manager, if there is one, please stop allowing these unnecessary downgrades of Signal to continue. * Please at least gives us the option to have larger text! * Again, let the window expand as we write... Although we appreciate the app & the idea, too often, a call doesn't connect & we have to restart app or even the phone. It's been like this for a looong time! On Android & iPoo. Have shared with many & many have same issue. Haven't noticed any improvement with this in 2 years. Video quality on calls not impressive. Sound quality sometimes OK. Good for sending files (sometimes). Wonder about any real privacy, since there's a mic in the phone? How does actual ""privacy"" happen in this situation? Signal is definitely worth having. Worth hoping for better... Nice to know (or ""believe"") Devs care about the consuming population. The way we actually speak of it is 4 stars. These words represent several individuals who use Signal. Thanks for doing your best!"
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,65.19160583941606,3,1,"Idea is great and I love using this app, but parts need refining. Sorting items (ToDos, Dailies, etc) from the app doesn't persist, but doing so from the website does. There is a widget for Habits and Dailies, but not for ToDos, and I this ToDos is the list people would best like to see made into a widget. There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit). Would be nice if you could automatically sort by Due Date ascending. Creating a Daily and setting it to all days, then editing it and removing the current day still leaves the Daily Active (Same with the reverse if it was first created as not enabled for this day of the week, then editing and enabling it, it remains disabled). Etc , My point is the idea is amazing, there is a huge community behind it which is great, and I personally love the app. But it lacks polish around the edges and some bugs could be fixed."
org.wordpress.android,63.18248175182482,2,4,"It's worse sorry Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post. I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are. I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible.  I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.  Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter.  Please switch back to the normal way of adding images. Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,63.065693430656935,2,130,"The ""make profile visible"" issue is a constant source of frustration for all the users on my signal threads. On my (android) phone, I get a pop up window when I first join or start a thread which lets me make my profile visible but once done, there is no way view that setting. If you have several threads, it's hard to remember if you did that and impossible to verify that you did it correctly. We all end up spending a good deal of our time asking each other if you can see see my name and telling each other to access settings that either don't exist or are practically impossible to find. I think it may be different for iphone users because some on the thread swear that it's available any time but I've spent well over an hour on my phone trying every possible icon to no avail. Other users who don't have that problem are annoyed that they can't see my profile probably think I'm just not able to figure it out. Please just make a simple button in settings for all users of both platforms to make the profile visible!"

org.wordpress.android,60.839416058394164,2,12,"The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update. The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access. It was always the first thing I looked at whenever I opened up the app.     I maintain several WP sites for myself, both business and personal. I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.    I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change. I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.  Otherwise, at least in my opinion, they've partially crippled the app."

com.habitrpg.android.habitica,60.14598540145985,3,0,"Wonderful potential and with excellent content but not very well executed. UI poor & buggy; connectivity & state-saving bugs; unintuitive & hazy. However, still a tremendous tool with (I don't use this term lightly) life-changing potential despite! I feel as though the gamification aspect is tangential but foundational to the system design. If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side. The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them. Incredible, and there's also arts exposure, bookclubbing, hobbyisting, and more being done through the system as well. Bottom line is same as the top: This has awesome potential to (actually) help people improve their lives but the system isn't designed very well and on top of that the app isn't up to professional standards.  Don't have it? Get it, and start it. Try it for a couple weeks if you can. Keep reading..."

org.wordpress.android,58.46897810218978,1,1,"Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor. This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images. It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor. Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started. Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface. I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,58.46167883211679,1,1,"STOP! Using Signal as your SMS app traps you forever! I found this out when I switched devices: Any friends who've sent a Signal message can't send an SMS to that person anymore. Anyone who has to stop using Signal for any reason becomes unreachable & the devs labeled the problem ""won't fix"". Once someone texts you by Signal, Signal won't let them send an SMS anymore; there is no option, no fix. Signal messages sent to a former user go to a black hole. No failure message, no notice that it wasn't received; SMS messages come in & your responses go nowhere. In short, trying Signal with even a few friends FU¢<S YOU out of them ever being able to reach you by SMS ever again (unless they ALL quit using the app?). It's evil. DO NOT USE THIS APP FOR SMS! Ironically upbeat original review follows: Better than most messaging apps, has a nice Dark theme, & can also be your default SMS app, which is convenient (it's a trap! See warning at top). I don't like it telling everyone in my phone book that I'm on Signal. That's pretty invasive & should be optional. Encrypted Signal conversations seem to be stored only on each device, which is more secure, but means that if you reinstall or lose/break your phone, you lose all previous messages, irretrievably. Worse, there's no method to save just one conversation, just a raw .xml log of every message ever, with no encryption. A more secure way to back up individual conversations would put this app in 5-star territory. A Search to pick out certain words in my message history would be super handy too. So would Google Voice integration, or Google Hangouts, Google Allo, or Google Duo... Or get really wild & support WhatsApp messaging so we don't need both apps! Signal is not a decentralized messaging network, so it'll only work as long as Signal's servers are online, & encrypting the transmissions won't help if your phone (or your associate's phone) is hacked; Actual ""privacy"" may vary based upon your skills & how exposed you are in other ways. Don't blame the app if your device is insecure! Overall it's a very pleasant app to use. Making it my default SMS app means I never have to look at a phone's ugly default Messaging app (also means I'm trapped forever! See warning at top). If there's a better encrypted messaging app, I can't tell you about it. DO NOT USE FOR SMS, SEE WARNING AT TOP."
org.thoughtcrime.securesms,58.21167883211679,1,0,"This app is used all the time and is nearly perfect. Really bad with media though.  Only one image at a time. Can't send video sizes that standard pixel app can but pixel is special like that though even note 5 couldn't send much of a video file. Can't send messages to people without having to show your phone number which would make it more stealth. Also if you set messages to dissapear after certain time frame if android to iPhone , the time will go back to not dissapearing when the other person replies if they haven't also set it the same or set it at all. Also shame that it doesn't let you choose a app icon and shows its a messenger app unless you use a entire icon pack or launcher like nova.  Pixel is best phone ever and is only phone I haven't rooted and I'd like the app icon to appear as a calculator icon but I then have to change my launcher which sucks.  For a stealth app we should have icon options for home screen.   HOWEVER apparently the SMS and calls are secure and not logged with telco and not able to be retrieved from phone once deleted and can't be listened into so thats awesome if it's legit.  I know for a fact that if you out spyware on a mobile and clone a phone without person knowing then you can NOT view signal app SMS like you can every other app but you can listen to phone calls if you have control over the other handset microphone which can't be helped.   It's a legit app.very good at the basic needs so long as what we are told about it not being logged or recorded is true.  I'd pay plenty for this app if I had to and was able to attach a file or multiple images.  Would be great if you could have an option to send a message in a image too. So anybody who finds your phone and opens app sees a picture but not the message unless they had a code to extract the message from the picture like another appointment I've seen.

There are buttons that just look like explanatory text and other things that look like buttons that aren't.  If I hatch a new pet or try to make a new change to my avatar it can sometimes take several minutes for the app to recognize and show the change, meanwhile I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.  The entire party structure and invitation setup is needlessly complicated and frustrating.  The actual task/to do list setup is great. That section of the app is what we're here for and it's really great. The reward and group mechanics are good motivators. It's just the structure of the game that needs improvement."

If a user has Signal installed and then uninstalls it, but doesn't unregister their Signal account, your texts will be sent via Signal and your intended recipient won't receive them via their SMS app. There's not a way for you to really know they uninstalled unless they tell you and it needs to be made more apparent to the user when they uninstall that they also need to unregister their account. Luckily, if you know your texts are going to a black hole, you can hold the ""Send"" button and force it to go via unencrypted SMS. I had 2 people who thought I was ghosting them because of this engineering oversight. You can still receive their texts, but they can't receive yours, so it makes you think communication is all good. Other than this massive flaw it's a fantastic app. Love the UI and feature set, but if there's even the slightest chance that I can send texts to someone and have them not receive it, that needs to be addressed ASAP before I can recommend this to anyone else. I've seen many threads open on this same topic and it falls on deaf ears. Pleeease devs, realize it's a problem and take steps to fix it! Some potential solutions: 1. Make it clear to the user when they uninstall that they also need to unregister 2. If someone's messages come in unencrypted, obviously they uninstalled Signal. The app should prompt a warning that the user likely uninstalled and that they won't receive your texts if you try to send via Signal, and recommend switching to unencrypted SMS. That's just off the top of my head and I'm sure there's more elegant ways to solve it."

When i install the app, i have to recharge twice, sometimes 3 times each day. Even with minimal use. When i remove it or use another lock screen, my battery lasts all day with 1 charge. So i know this is the culprit.   Another very, VERY minor negative point is that it leaves up a notification when it's active. But it's easily hidden, so it's barely an issue at all.  But thats about the only complaints i have with it. The rest is nothing other then amazing. Touching the notification to see a preview is a feature i really miss in other lockscreens who only do dismiss/open actions.   On the visual front, it's awesome. With no notifications, it's minimalistic at best (in a good way). When you play music, or touch a notification, the blackground changes to a blurred version of the image it's displaying. Simple but beautiful.    I'm giving it 3 stars. I don't use it anymore because of the battery drain, but i will check out AcDisplay every so often to see if it is more battery efficient. When it does, it can stay permanently.   (Tested with Samsung Galaxy S4)"

I appreciate that the developers need and deserved to be paid for their hard work, but not being able to use most of the rpg elements, negated the motivation to stay productive and use the app. I like the idea of accountability among friends, but the invite system is unusable. It's a QR code and aside from having no idea what to do with it, every time I clicked on it, it downloaded somewhere I couldn't find it on my S8. With a few changes, this could be an amazing app, but it feels like many of the gameplay elements were added as an afterthought to a regular organization app instead of making being productive in real life feel like a game.

There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because, in this app, an administrator can ""Reply"" to comment that is pending moderation, but in the regular WP Admin interface, the button is labeled ""Approve and Reply"" not just ""Reply.""

A majority of internet users don't use full browsers to surf it. So this app had to be good, because your habits are a private and important thing. And it's absolutely not good. The last (but not only) straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place, and won't clear. Inviting people to your party was way too confusing, until I found out it didn't even work until I did it manually *on the site*. There's more, but I won't bother. I know its supposed to be open source but is ANY testing happening? I was trying to be an advocate for this and you guys just killed it for me with this bad app."

Only problems I have with the app are the glitches and errors that occur, such as the tags, not appearing, and items not syncing properly after I have used them.

I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads.

org.thoughtcrime.securesms,32.613138686131386,3,0,"Beware: does not work with hands free Bluetooth or when WiFi signal is weak (despite having cellular option enabled) . I love this app and use it, but I have to point out two seriously major flaws. The first: some vehicles send out an automated text via Bluetooth that says ""I'm driving."" when the user is operating a vehicle and receives a text. This feature does not work with this app. In fact it appears anything sending texts via Bluetooth does not work, so people that communicate hands free are out of luck. Next, if your WiFi strength is weak, the app can't send or receive texts which I think is dangerous. In fact the app doesn't even show me my contact names,  just phone numbers. Once I get better WiFi or sign off WiFi altogether,  it works correctly again.  They need to change it so if a message can't be sent in WiFi,  it falls back to cellular. And yes,  I've confirmed I have cellular checked in the settings."

I tried contacting support and they gave me a list of stuff to do which i did. It did not work and they stopped responding.

The app was great in my old fone but when i installed it in the new device (redmi3sprime), i stopped getting notified from wordpress when somebody likes or replies to my comments. I have checked with the notification settings n app settings n they are ON. I checked with the settings on my fone too.  Yet im not getting any notifications. What do i do? ."
org.wordpress.android,30.799270072992698,1,2,I hate WordPress Not only the app. The website logged me out and told me I need a new password so I reset it and it just did the exact same thing. I uploaded one piece and now I can't even access my account. I feel like I have been robbed of my own work. I wish I could write another review because one doesn't show how disappointed and disgusted I am with word press. This is my first day using WordPress and I have spent more time trying to login and reset a password then actually getting to post content.
org.wordpress.android,30.799270072992698,2,6,I can't post anything. I've tried several times to use the hoping for convenience. I have not found using this app convenient at all. I can't update posts or pages. I can't upload media files. After trying to update or upload the app continue to retry. I would love to actually be able to use the WordPress app without being frustrated.
org.wordpress.android,30.79014598540146,2,1,Mobile web page does more The iOS & mobile browser versions have more functionality than the Android app. (Can't set featured image for example). I would rather maintain my site via the browser or iPhone than through this app.
org.wordpress.android,30.79014598540146,2,1,"The app was working fine. But with the latest updates, blog posts, comments, pages etc. are not getting displayed on the mobile. Login works fine, xmlrpc is fine."
org.wordpress.android,30.78102189781022,3,0,"Great potential, but... One of the major attractions this app has for me is the ability to write offline posts. However, two bugs make it completely unusable for that purpose. First of all, adding images offline and then reopening the post with an active internet connection removes all the images. Second, if the internet connection fails during a post upload (eg one with 30 images), the whole upload hangs, the app has to be force closed and then the upload restarted from scratch... This has litteraly cost me hours of my time."
