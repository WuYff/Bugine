org.wordpress.android,122.48449612403101,2,2,"This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read, write and relax, but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing.  This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example, instead all we get is the ""discover"" feature which only promotes bland, vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories, or video game strategies, or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive, to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is, otherwise you have to look it up manually.  There are no set categories or tags, instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post, which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers.  People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted, discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want.  You can't dislike posts or comments, so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes,  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways, while WordPress does not.  The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear.  All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community, and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white."

It works best if you find your destination address with a browser, as the names in OSM don't always match. Due to size limits, searching by street numbers is not possible and this severely limits your options. The app goes nuts if your GPS is broken, and you can't just follow the route by moving the map with fingers, as popups keep reappearing. Maps.me is best if you just move to points you know in advance, using the best in class bookmark system"

Recent version seemed to be acting perversely, sending one to slip road to exit motorway only to rejoin it. Also no option for using motorway if available. Not good. Also it would be useful to be able to have waypoints and preferred routes and types of roads to avoid. Updated version now doesn't bring up saved favourites when planning route when tapping on To button. Another feature absent is any indication of the name of the road you are on, or, often, the junction numbers on motorways.

org.wordpress.android,80.30426356589147,1,1,"What happened to the full editor??!!! Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird, useless version of what it was before. I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent, center, size/place images, etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone. Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor. As well, the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog. Makes editing virtually impossible. - - - I received an automated response to this review which said, ""You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option. However, some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor, either."" - - - Found the setting. That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all. And, previously, before this change, the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features."

org.wordpress.android,79.75387596899225,1,1,"Inferior in every possible way to using the online editor. This app doesn't allow you to link to your own earlier posts, crashes often, can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page, and has issues previewing images. It also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor. Woe be unto you if you mak long pots, because after a certain size copy/paste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you. What it does do well is present your stats page, manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started. Though it has so many problems I'm just using the MS Office apps for my rough drafts and then copy/pasting into the web interface. I'll probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible."

Endless upload errors. Takes forever to post. And... ugh... what happened to my custom image resize controll'? Once upon a time this app worked beautifully and did what it should... you see... people posting from their phones are ON THE GO! I just want to post quickly with no hassle- the control needed but not clutter. Many times its mobile data, in a remote location. The app used to be lean and mean and do the job perfectly. Now its like it's a mini desktop app that's bogged down with junk. What used to take seconds... select some pics on phone ... share to WP app... add text hit upload and DONE... is now futz with this and that ... fight the awful quirks ...hit post and wait wait wait...error. error.

com.habitrpg.android.habitica,78.48837209302326,2,0,"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus"
org.wordpress.android,78.40310077519379,2,4,"It's worse sorry Since the last update I can't use my regular photo viewer to choose pictures from my post. I now have a list of images that seem to come from my tablet but not it's sd card; where all my images are. I have around 30,000 images in various picture folders (I am travelling and have a 128GB sd card in my tablet where my images are stored)  and this update to 3.9 has made choosing images impossible.  I have two possible workarounds. Either I upload the images to google or similar and put a link in the post to them. Or my second option is to upload the images in the WordPress app through the media menu item and then choose these images I want in the post using your new chooser interface.  Honestly I see what you are trying to do with the new interface but it does limit the user as to how they choose their images. Handing this task over to the operating system, as it was before, makes more sense and makes your app lighter.  Please switch back to the normal way of adding images. Updating posts on tablets and phones has been great with the WordPress app and I feel it's just been made more difficult with this update."

org.wordpress.android,76.55038759689921,2,12,"The update buried the feature I use most in the app This app was great until the last update. The part of the app that I used the most was the admin page access. It was always the first thing I looked at whenever I opened up the app.     I maintain several WP sites for myself, both business and personal. I use the app for when I don't want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates.      Where I thought the app shined was maintaining my WP sites. The app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or WP updates. After selecting the admin option, I could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated, significantly quicker than using a pc to do it.    With the latest update to the app, the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep, so what would take me 1 click + a click per site to check update status, now requires me to click into the settings, then 2 clicks per site to check for update status.    I considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change. I'm hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that they'll fix this in the next update.

I need these links to submit post to my editor through Slack or Trello. 3-There is no word count visible. I need that since the sites I write for have a minimum word count.

The layout on my tablet leaves a lot of negative unused space, if you put the options icons on the left and had a view of your feed/blog on the right it would greatly improve upon that. I do not like how you can not preview or view any blog, I think its a bit absurd that I have to use my browser to actually see my blogs. I also noticed you can not add/create a new blog on the app, I would have to do this in the browser as well and reload my account into this app for the new blog to appear in the drop down. Over all the app is visually appealing, quick and operates effeciently on my tablet, but the missing features completely deture me from keeping this app when I can probably find a compatible blogging app that suits my needs more.

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,72.28488372093022,3,99,"I started using this 2 years ago, and it was very good then. With recent updates the quality of routes for pedestrians has declined sharply.  I was recently in Manchester and could see my destination 100m down the street, yet maps.me wanted me walk 250m round a block. It was giving me a driving route, although I checked, it was set to pedestrians.  The version of a year ago was better for walking."

No reply after two weeks. ------------- Next I uninstalled & re-installed the app (for the 12th time trying to fix the vanishing maps problem). Now the place in Settings to tell the app where to store the maps is gone. Gone! (The SD is 32 GB and has 31 GB free) I wrote the developer. After a week- no reply. ---------- Uninstall Warning: Each time I uninstalled the app., a large folder (Over 1 GB on mine) was left behind on the phone. One must use a file manager to delete it. --------- I Give Up (Which is too bad because this app is easy to use.) UPDATE- As shown below, the someone from the developer company posted suggestions. I had already tried (multiple times) what is suggested in the links the person posted. I also had already sent e-mails to the address shown. I will try one more time to contact them (because it looks like a fun & easy app). If no luck, I'll have to conclude that my phone and this app just won't play well together.

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,71.5406976744186,1,11,"Blatant internal storage hog.  Each time the app is updated, it decides to fill up the internal phone storage, rather than the the SD card. And following an app update, you then MUST re-download ALL previously downloaded apps, and again, fill up the phone storage not the SD.  At over half a Gigabyte of app and mapping data, this app is just blatantly greedy, and the developers are either too lazy or too incompetent to design an app appropriately to store directly on exterior SD card storage. ----------- WHY do I have to download maps again following app update?  EDIT: why also the need to automatically start up at boot?  This app is getting very tiresome to use - weekly updates, repeatedly having to download all previous map files after every app update, frequent nag screens.

com.mapswithme.maps.pro,71.18023255813952,1,1,"Effectively useless for cycle routing. I downloaded this to get cycle routing which Google maps doesn't offer in Central America. Maps.Me does do cycle routing but it's effectively useless. First, it only offers you one route to your destination, so if you were thinking about taking another road, too bad, maps.me will not show you how long that road might be. You only get the one suggestion and no others, and no way to make it give you other options.  Second, there's clearly a compulsion by the app to avoid anything it thinks is a highway at all costs. So you end up with totally bizarre and out of the way routes when there's a direct road from you to your destination. This avoidance of highways would be ok if you were given more than one route to choose from, or you could turn off the 'avoid highways' preference. Unfortunately this is not possible. All of this might be fine in the US or Western Europe, but in Mexico and Central America if a road doesn't have a number (and is nominally a highway) it probably isn't paved. So avoiding anything with a number is basically going to be sending you along a lot of dirt roads. The app is also then also avoiding lots of rural highways, totally quiet, beautiful, no traffic, two lane roads.   Finally, they made a big deal with an update that made the app display an elevation profile for cycle routes too. This is a big deal for cyclists, as it's important to know the hills you have in front of you (or at least on the one route the app wants you to take). Sadly, this elevation profile is effectively useless too. The profile had nothing on it to show scale, so you have no idea how high the individual peaks are. There is one number given next to an up/down arrow symbol which I think must be net gain??? Or maybe it's total gain??  I really have no idea. And honestly, if you're going to give me one number, give me the highest altitude I'll reach on that route. From there I can guestimate the other climbs.  Maybe the app is ideal for driving. Maybe it works better for cyclists in cities. I don't know. I do know that it's pretty useless for me, except in the rare circumstances that the app and I are in agreement about which road to take."
org.wordpress.android,71.1453488372093,3,23,"The app is pretty handcuffed when compared with the web editor. The app lacks easy linking to already published posts, a way to copy a previous post, and the mouse support on Android is terrible - formatting buttons and most dialog boxes don't respond to mouse clicks at all. Basic interaction with the admin side, such as comment moderation and stats are fine, but for actually creating and publishing content, the app is very much a second class citizen compared to the web editor. Full integration of the web editor capabilities would make for a much better experience."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,71.06976744186046,3,0,"Maps.me is usually better than nothing. Route planning is not the best. I could not drag a route to change it, and the app often refused to plan a route that ran near uninstalled maps. At one point, the route it chose added about an hour to a six-hour drive. The triangle icon indicating direction of travel often pointed perpendicular or opposite to the actual direction of travel, or ran alongside the road, or across open fields or bodies of water. Amusing on the autobahn, but a real pain when driving slowly or walking in a city center or small village. Gives very short notice for lane changes/exits. And unlike Google Maps which will say ""slight right"" or ""use right lane,"" this app tends to say only ""turn right!"" Which, again, is confusing. If you can use it, Google Maps is way better. But this did have the best interface/features of the various OSM-using apps that I looked at. I'd probably use it again, but only as the last resort."

There is a widget for Habits and Dailies, but not for ToDos, and I this ToDos is the list people would best like to see made into a widget. There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit). Would be nice if you could automatically sort by Due Date ascending. Creating a Daily and setting it to all days, then editing it and removing the current day still leaves the Daily Active (Same with the reverse if it was first created as not enabled for this day of the week, then editing and enabling it, it remains disabled).

If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did."

I had a difficult time using the app, because the tutorials were very basic and didn't cover most of what to do. It seemed like if you didn't buy gems, then you couldn't go on quests. I appreciate that the developers need and deserved to be paid for their hard work, but not being able to use most of the rpg elements, negated the motivation to stay productive and use the app. I like the idea of accountability among friends, but the invite system is unusable. It's a QR code and aside from having no idea what to do with it, every time I clicked on it, it downloaded somewhere I couldn't find it on my S8. With a few changes, this could be an amazing app, but it feels like many of the gameplay elements were added as an afterthought to a regular organization app instead of making being productive in real life feel like a game. I love the health system and the seperation of habits and dailies. I also love that you're health decreases when you don't complete a daily task. If the party and questing system were improved, my productivity and appreciation for this app would soar.

org.wordpress.android,69.04651162790698,1,0,"Even though I tried this with different keyboards it's editing capabilies are poor.   They don't come up to any of the external editors that I have on my tablet.   Compared to the pc/web version this is crippled.  One reason I would like an external editor is that I have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to 'snapshot' or, for example, undo deletions.  rather than sweat coding more editor functions, simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible.  There are a lot of management features in the PC/web version that I consider very basic.  being able to edit the raw HTML code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the 'visual' mode doesn't permit is one.   Again, this might be resolved with an external editor: edit in visual/text or in html switch.  Perhaps the simplest demonstration of what's lacking is to run the tablet and the PC/web version side by side.  I realize there is a screen real estate issue, especially when trying to run this on a 4.5 inch phone, but perhaps that's a case of ""you shouldn't be doing that"".

The entire party structure and invitation setup is needlessly complicated and frustrating.  The actual task/to do list setup is great. That section of the app is what we're here for and it's really great. The reward and group mechanics are good motivators. It's just the structure of the game that needs improvement."
com.mapswithme.maps.pro,68.86046511627906,2,0,"I've been using Maps.me for about a month now as a backup to my Garmin as I travel around Europe. It does a decent job of helping you navigate around city's. However it is borderline useless when navigating great distances. It only offers one route and it is always the most direct route. That means if the most direct route is through the center of a massive city as supposed to using a ring road. It's taking you through the city. This has happened to me a few times while using maps.me and since I don't know the area it's bitten me in the ass almost everytime. Something that would take 30min using the ring roads instead takes 2hrs because you have to go through the whole city. It also has a very hard time rerouting. Several times I followed the road signs instead of the app and it refused to reroute, it didn't even reroute a turn around. It just kept spinning the map in circles. Like I said for city nav it's not bad, Google maps is better but this is a decent no data options. But for long drives I'd avoid this app."

The routing is actually ok, although the estimated timings don't take traffic conditions into account. The offline operation is good, but there isn't really an 'online' mode. If I currently have a good connection I want to be able to search a new area without having to download the section first. But what has killed it for me is that the search is useless. There us no UK postcode search, which is what I primarily use. Searching by street name sometimes works, but often comes up empty. Conversely when there are multiple matches adding extra location details (borough, etc) doesn't narrow the search effectively. As far as i can tell it treats each term entered separately and at some point if you haven't chosen one of the matches for your first term and keep typing it switches to searching on the second term, ignoring the first. I only managed to experience the navigation by finding places on Google maps, and then matching the street pattern and zooming to find them manually in this. I gather it works better in some countries than others, so I'll probably try it again sometime, but for now I'm giving up."

The biggest shortcoming for me was that with just about all osm apps, the POI/address search are useless unless those items are entered in the osm database. A suggestion would be to have a online search function (like MapFactor's google search) to be able to find those items and be able to translate the info into an offline nav point.

It's a nice, useful app with some gaps--I really like the basic idea and the maps themselves are accurate and occasionally have nice details (for example, airport gate numbers).  There are some major gaps in searching for foods, shopping, etc., though. Primarily this is just in not having locations. For example, in one city in Japan I did a search for food and it came up with maybe 3 or 4 places when I was aware of dozens close by.  Since it pretty quickly looks for options further away, I was getting results up to fifty miles away (in Japan, traveling fifty miles can take several hours).  It also missed the biggest shopping center in the area.  Still, it's handy for knowing where you are and had the ability to download sections of the world's you're interested in.the interface is also easy to navigate and it came up with Japanese city names easily even though I was using English letters.  Train stations are well-marked and it's pretty easy to follow along with your reason trip to know how much further you need to go and where to get off (note that the routing itself i s by driving rather than public transport, which would have been a nice feature, but that you can simply see where the tracks are)."

However, I found that full version severely flawed. While the program correctly identified my being at my home, and while it correctly identified the name of the street I was on, when I tried to search for my full address, including the house number, it could not find the address and suggested similarly named streets in other towns. When I asked for the Walgreen pharmacy, it identified such pharmacies in distances of over 4 miles, but failed to identify the pharmacy that is less than half a mile from where I was. When I asked for restaurants, it failed to identify the 99 Restaurant two blocks away from my home, while identifying another restaurants offer the same chain, several miles away.  In my opinion, the application completely failed the test.

I am aware you can opt out of most advertising by going to settings and switching off ""Show offers"", but there's no garuntee your app will stop giving other unwanted push notifications, such as the one asking if the user is aware of the bookmarking feature. DO NOT engage the user outside of the app unless it is for a currently requested function or feature they are actively using, such as continuing navigation while in the background. There are better ways to let users know of features. For example, highlight the area you want to be noticed and give a brief message when the app is launched.

Sometimes for a minute, or 2, or 5, sometimes it just hung and you had to kill the app and restart it. The voice announcements still worked (as did the speed indicator), but since this app's turn-by-turn instructions are often ambiguous and sometimes just plain wrong, you can't rely on them, so having a frozen map is really the worst thing for navigation. We lost quite a bit of time around Arnhem, Oosterbeek, Nijmegen, etc. having to stop at the side of the road to restart the navigation.

There is a very unstable behavior you need to solve. When walking along a planned path, even a very straight one, the view keep rotating clockwise and back. This is annoying behavior. 4. When walking along a plan path, the software does not take care to move the visible map window, therefore I have to take care of this. 5. It should be possible to decide which data layer is drawn. For example, when I look for a monument and the search can not find it and I want to finger choose it, I don't want to see icons of restaurants. 6. There should be integrated icon explanation. 7.

Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page.

The first week was hell trying to drive a wide motor home on narrow single lane back roads with oncoming traffic.

I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads.

There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because, in this app, an administrator can ""Reply"" to comment that is pending moderation, but in the regular WP Admin interface, the button is labeled ""Approve and Reply"" not just ""Reply.""

The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them.

Turn directions do not include street name that you're turning onto. Distances read out in feet instead of miles (""turn left in 3000 feet"" vs. 1/2 mile).

Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour.

Two complaints: 1) I paid for a premium version of this app over a year ago so I would not have to deal with ads and now I have to pay to remove the ads and 2) after this most recent update I am having issues looking at the guides. I am using an Android Motorola Z2 force.

It does not offer alternate routes, and is slow too recalculate if you leave the offered route, so it keeps giving old route directions until it sorts it out, which is confusing.

However the real problem is that I am unable to create anything but short routes due to the limitations in the amount of stops that I can add; given there are tons of forest roads you can never pick the one you like and make something longer than 30km of a route; It also isn't even a paid feature, I'd have paid for such feature in a heartbeat.  Two fixes, having 3 stops is ok if I can chain routes, as in save them and load them quickly; or allowing to add up to 10+ stops, the average that you need on 80+km rides on these forest mazes.  Back to square one having to buy a GPS, and these garmins aren't cheap at all; I am however pleased on how close this was to actually work, that I dared to write this review; hoping they implement it, even if it's paid; maybe they can have competition in something they never expected to."

Trying to arrange directions for future reference (or point A to point B) is irritating since it wants to automatically start from your current GPS location so unless you dance around the houses it's not that user friendly and frankly is mostly irritating and not as good as Google maps.

Once decided which motorway to us, the app is willing to direct you a few miles in the wrong direction instead of choosing the shortest/fasted link. Also I noticed that is does direct you to closed roads (andosm use the same maps not having this problem).

It should search only in the city you are at. If it had google's map search engine like, this would be definitely the best offline app for maps.  And it is not possible to add a city name with the street you are searching. As soon as you start typing more letters all the results disappear and a weeping dog appear saying ""no results"".
