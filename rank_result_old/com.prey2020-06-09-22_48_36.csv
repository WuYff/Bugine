com.habitrpg.android.habitica,70.48076923076923,3,1,"Idea is great and I love using this app, but parts need refining. Sorting items (ToDos, Dailies, etc) from the app doesn't persist, but doing so from the website does. There is a widget for Habits and Dailies, but not for ToDos, and I this ToDos is the list people would best like to see made into a widget. There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit). Would be nice if you could automatically sort by Due Date ascending. Creating a Daily and setting it to all days, then editing it and removing the current day still leaves the Daily Active (Same with the reverse if it was first created as not enabled for this day of the week, then editing and enabling it, it remains disabled). Etc , My point is the idea is amazing, there is a huge community behind it which is great, and I personally love the app. But it lacks polish around the edges and some bugs could be fixed."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,67.1923076923077,2,0,"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus"
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,63.88461538461538,3,0,"good foundation, but very basic it has some solid concepts. there's a decent amount of customization available, allowing you to set dailies as only recurring on certain days/after a specific amount of time, setting start dates for dailies and due dates for todos, customizing difficulty and reward. the punishment system is a nice touch. my main issues are lack of reminder options, inability to log yesterday's info, and inability to rearrange tasks. the app interface could also stand to be prettier, but the rpg element is cute and fun."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,59.53846153846153,3,38,"Really unique app that motivates me to get stuff done. Unfortunately, this app needs A LOT of work. I tried writing a message in a guild chat. Once it got long enough, the words disappeared behind my keyboard so I couldn't see what I was writing. When I put the keyboard down, the send button disappeared..as a result I couldn't send my message. Theres no search for trying to find a challenge that suits you. Theres no notifications when your party is chatting. There is also no search for guilds. I just started this app and so for these are the problems I've noticed. Otherwise it is great and I hope it improves."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,59.26923076923076,3,0,"Wonderful potential and with excellent content but not very well executed. UI poor & buggy; connectivity & state-saving bugs; unintuitive & hazy. However, still a tremendous tool with (I don't use this term lightly) life-changing potential despite! I feel as though the gamification aspect is tangential but foundational to the system design. If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side. The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them. Incredible, and there's also arts exposure, bookclubbing, hobbyisting, and more being done through the system as well. Bottom line is same as the top: This has awesome potential to (actually) help people improve their lives but the system isn't designed very well and on top of that the app isn't up to professional standards.  Don't have it? Get it, and start it. Try it for a couple weeks if you can. Keep reading..."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,58.53846153846153,2,0,"Good idea in theory but the interface is way too ham-handed. If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,52.34615384615384,3,0,"I really, really wanted to like this. The concept is genius, but the execution needs a little tweaking. I had a difficult time using the app, because the tutorials were very basic and didn't cover most of what to do. It seemed like if you didn't buy gems, then you couldn't go on quests. I appreciate that the developers need and deserved to be paid for their hard work, but not being able to use most of the rpg elements, negated the motivation to stay productive and use the app. I like the idea of accountability among friends, but the invite system is unusable. It's a QR code and aside from having no idea what to do with it, every time I clicked on it, it downloaded somewhere I couldn't find it on my S8. With a few changes, this could be an amazing app, but it feels like many of the gameplay elements were added as an afterthought to a regular organization app instead of making being productive in real life feel like a game. I love the health system and the seperation of habits and dailies. I also love that you're health decreases when you don't complete a daily task. If the party and questing system were improved, my productivity and appreciation for this app would soar. Please don't stop improving and developing this app. It could be a trendsetter for a whole new genre of games."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,51.71153846153845,1,1,"First thing I did when I installed the app was disable notifications and yet I still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long. That aside, the app is poorly made. UI is very buggy. Chat functions are glitchy and don't update mezsages correctly. Sometimes the main ui responds to nothing. You can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again. Almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,50.30769230769231,1,0,"This is my second time returning, and after a 2 year hiatus, I'm pleased to say that everything I hated about this app is still there and nothing new has really changed. It's so buggy and I can't get any help on any of the bugs I experience. Like the fact that I don't do any damage when my cron rolls over. Yea… I get no response from the developers.  The only reason I use this app is for the sake of quests? Because everything else is so boring. But even the quests are dull. And if you're in a big party, they don't even scale it properly? There's nothing like having a quest start and then having it finish a couple hours later before you even have a chance to do anything. Not to mention it totally lacks the ability remind you of anything. All it does is nag you everyday at a set time. That's all it's capable of. Set a to do with a due date? Great but you won't get a reminder about it. Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities. And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it. Which I don't buy because I've used other apps like this where I can go offline and use it. Its slow as hell.  And for forcing me to be connected to the internet it doesn't even notify me of new posts from my guilds and party."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,48.5,1,2,"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on..."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,47.51923076923077,3,73,"I only wish it worked offline :&lt;. I get that offline you wouldn't be able to buy stuff and chat, but the basic features of making tasks, checking them, and getting points/experience could be offline. I'm uninstalling because I don't have space for an app I can only use at school, but if you fix this, I'll very gladly reinstall. This is an amazing concept, and I love this app, so please work on this."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,44.88461538461539,2,106,Wonderful app other than the fact days end at midnight. With the schedule I'm on my day doesn't end until 2am so I'd have to get all my dailies done two hours before bed in order to not be penalized. Severely disappointed that this can't be changed in game as it renders the app useless to me.
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,44.76923076923077,3,2,"Great app when it works I actually really like this app, but after a week of using it I keep getting server connection error notifications when I enter a new task. The app the creates two identical 'ghost' tasks that don't actually register. Alternatively they do register but when I go to tick one as complete the server connection error comes up again and I get no reward for completion. Makes it difficult to keep using the app."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,44.69230769230769,2,0,"Great app based on features, AWFUL due to bugs! Still using it daily, after restarting it several times, but the bugs are a huge drawback!  Will change the review once I will be able to rearrange the tasks without having them moved back were they  were (or placed somewhere in-between), when it wouldn't crash when I set a notification on a task, when the party tabs don't appear on tasks view, and when the animals appear in the app when they are found, not hours later (refresh + app restart = no use in this case)."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,44.32692307692307,2,47,"I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right. Whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted. I did everything the helpers told me (clear cache, reinstall the app, restart phone) and nothing worked. Its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,44.13461538461538,3,11,"Habitica was very fun for a time... then I quickly became disengaged. None of my friends play so I was unable to go on quests. Once I had equipment, a pet, and a mount I liked there was very little remaining to keep me engaged. I can't recommend using it single player. I am aware there are guilds to help you meet parties so you can adventure but I am disinclined to meet strangers just to keep my tasks organized. Also I'll note that the penalties for not engaging in dailies are so minimal that I was never worried about skipping anything... and since the benefits are randomized (apparently heavily towards potion and foods, not eggs) I wasn't incentivized to try for any specific type of activity beyond things I just wanted to get done."

com.habitrpg.android.habitica,43.69230769230769,3,0,"I like the idea, however for me there are several things, that made me uninstall app:  1) i failed to find proper/adequate rewards for the things i do, the whole effort-reward ratio is totally vague and completely up to you.  People who need a holding hand to stay motivated (those who install this app) shouldn't be given too much power.  2) the exp gain is completely uncontrollable and can be abused, no daily cap whatsoever.   The daily exp cap could at least be some kind of a max gauge meter point, which would be a good decision helper in terms of ""how much exp should i get for doing X"" and distributing your daily task load.  3)it takes progressively more exp for new levels and it only makes sense in mmo, not real life. Irl it depends very much on what you're doing, and getting less levels for doing same things could be demotivating.  4)need better char models and more customization. You know how people like skins and pretty looking chars, right? They are even ready to get things done for that."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,42.96153846153846,2,0,"Visually Appealing, But Unusable I am a big fan of the browser version of Habitica, and I use the dailies feature to successfully juggle my regular responsibilities as they come and go.  I was excited to see that the app was getting a much needed overhaul.  However, the dailies section of the app shows ALL dailies, even completed ones, with no option to display only the tasks that are Due on a given day.  Seeing obligations I perform only on certain days or intervals mixed in with due and completed tasks render the app sadly unusable."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,42.80769230769231,2,4,"I honestly didn't get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything. Before that happened i started setting up daily tasks and the part where you set how often (such as the days of the week) you do each task was confusing. I would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them. Over all, too much work for its worth. Loved the idea though, it would have really gotten me doing things to level up and collect items"
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,42.53846153846153,3,0,"I was a little skeptical about getting this app, which gamifies you daily tasks, chores, etc; especially when I was trying to wean myself off of playing so much pc games. I was proven wrong, it really helps! The bonus is that you can have a support system consisted of real people when you join parties and guilds.   Only problems I have with the app are the glitches and errors that occur, such as the tags, not appearing, and items not syncing properly after I have used them. I didn't know what to do except go to settings and force stop the app. Sadly that caused the glitches and errors to become frequent. I finally Uninstalled/reinstalled the app, only to discover to same non-appearring tags glitch. Please fix this."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,42.38461538461538,2,0,"I was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits, dailies, to-do. After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me. Would keep using this app if I could keep the lists alone."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,42.38461538461538,2,0,"This app works awfully. Its a great idea but it needs tons of improvements.

But, I wish that it showed you past dates and all you accomplished on days previous, and I wish that the coloring of tasks wasn't so complicated when getting close to red or blue or whatever. Also, certain things are hard to navigate... but overall, I absolutely love this app. Use it every day. Not so much for challenges or battles, but for habit making and to do's."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,40.5,1,0,"Difficult decision (1) each daily task should warn me if I don't check it, the day after, in the morning while my memory is fresh. Instead there is one warning for all the tasks and it doesn't even notify, ever. (2) instead of the color of each habit/chore changing upon completion, each habit/chore should be a pet that grows every time you complete it. (3) I switched to Monsta Points app, because I can define my own rewards a little better. But I would come back if (1)+(2) were true."

There are buttons that just look like explanatory text and other things that look like buttons that aren't.  If I hatch a new pet or try to make a new change to my avatar it can sometimes take several minutes for the app to recognize and show the change, meanwhile I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.  The entire party structure and invitation setup is needlessly complicated and frustrating.  The actual task/to do list setup is great. That section of the app is what we're here for and it's really great. The reward and group mechanics are good motivators. It's just the structure of the game that needs improvement."

com.habitrpg.android.habitica,34.71153846153846,2,27,"I used to swear by Habitica for a long time, but frankly I find it almost unusable. The biggest, most important problem is the way sync works. You can't use Habitica if offline (or have bad internet connection), you can't click several buttons in quick succession, and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server, Android widgets are absolutely unusable. Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour. If every time I try to register a Habit or a Daily I must worry about Habitica not syncing properly, then it robs me of time and mental energy. Which makes it useless for actually instilling habits."

The UI looks nice, but that doesn't mean it's usable. I had a hard time figuring out the differences between the different areas to set up things you want to improve on. The terminology isn't understandable (no clue as to what separates Habits from Dailies from Tasks), and unfortunately, because I still couldn't understand what I was supposed to do and where, it's not very usable for me. The bug that left me in tutorial/hanging hell was enough.

Unfortunately the experience of using Talon is simply a chore. Tap tap tap. So many extra taps to do basic tasks. Hardly any options for tweaking outside of font choices/colors, so what you see is what you get. Liking/RT requires you to expand a tweet or tap a small hidden area for quick actions - it would be far quicker to simply have small buttons already in the timeline, or at least able to quickly expand without having to tap a tiny area (with no icon indicating it is there, I only discovered it by accident). Expanding a tweet in a conversation, for whatever reason, only loads the first 2-3 tweets. You have to then tap ""show all"" to actually see the conversation that the expanded tweet is a part of. I'm unsure why the developer just doesn't show the full conversation on the first tap. On top of that, conversations are unintuitively shown. When you tap a tweet in a conversation, it doesn't show the tweet & its place within the conversation, it shows the tweet isolated, requiring you to tap ""show all"" again to see the full conversation.

I'm not going to use this app any longer and will no longer be recommending this app to others. Your other apps are great however.   I thought this app would be great. It definitely looked the part. Unfortunately I am receiving immense battery drain even with Talon Pull off. It's silly and I'm not sure why. I've even turned syncing off entirely. I really want to use Talon Pull but it's not the same as receiving notifications like from the normal Twitter app. The other issue is when you're tagging people, why do random users show up instead of users that you follow or tag more often? It needs to be slightly similar to Twitter in that regard. I tweeted a picture a few days ago but couldn't find it on my twitter timeline. It was only visible on the desktop or normal Twitter app. If I could claim a refund now I would but sadly I've passed the date for reimbursement.

You must know your friends exact handle in order to tag them. Unbelievably annoying.  3. Getting to my own timeline is more difficult than it needs to be. If you're gonna have pages, allow for me to have my own timeline as one of the pages.  4. Polls simply don't work. They don't show up at all. 5.

It simple needs something to clearly display in one page, what's playing this week, another section below, for the following week, then another section below for what's due over a week, and another section below that with shows waiting to return, and finally another section at the bottom, for TV shows that have ended. That would be simple and consice. Additionally, displaying a number with the amount of episodes that you haven't watch yet, at the actual icon of the app, would be sensational. Just my two cents. All in all, a good app. Thanks and keep up the good work. Alan"
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,24.65384615384615,3,0,For the most part I love this app but lately it has started moving items around on my daily list when I check them done it's mostly when an item has a checklist of things to be done on them and it's really annoying to have to constantly reorder my list back in the order that I had it in. I would definitely change my rating if this bug got fixed.

I added one to-do to the list on pc yesterday, but it has yet to show up in the app, despite numerous refreshes and attempts to sync the two. That, in my opinion, is a big flaw. Perhaps, in time, it could be a good app. For now, it's merely serviceable. Mediocre. It can certainly be used without major issues, but there is plenty room for improvement."

I understand this was meant to be a feature (and will probably be met with some snarky comment based on the developer's previous responses) but it just doesn't work well. For whatever reason, tweet replies are chronological instead of by most popular. I'm sure I could change this somewhere, but no sorting or filter is immediately visible on that screen and I assume I'd need to dive into settings.

com.habitrpg.android.habitica,17.0,2,0,"1/5/20) I have tried the updates since my original post, and launch speed has slightly improved. Main Landing Page loads very slowly, but at least didn't crash right away again. Almost froze when scrolling through habits. I gave it more time to load, then tried going to a different section of the app & it crashed.. 11/9/19) Would be an awesome app, if it would load. Painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well. (Android 9 ; Moto G6 Play) Please fix! & I will actually update my review."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,17.0,3,4,"Great idea, not great implementation I use the app heavily, and it has improved over time, but not quickly. It's confusing, with a clunky UI. Recently I was getting several copies of tasks entered, and I kept telling the support forum in my browser. After the third time I bugged them, they told me to go report it on the support email on the app. Typical inefficient runaround. On the other hand, it really has improved my life."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,17.0,3,4,"I like the concept of the app and the fun gamification of reaching your goals however it is SUPER buggy on Android. The app is constantly quitting unexpectedly, not closing tasks properly and not doing rewards properly. I've reported it multiple times now and there has never been any update to fix it. I recommend going with another app if you have an Android device to save yourself the frustration."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,17.0,3,4,"This app has done a good job of helping me keep track of tasks. Dailies, Habits, and the To Do with checklists have been wonderful. I just don't like the new redesign. Nothing looks to be where it should be to me. It now feels bulky and clunky, and I feel like it will make me use it a lot less because it is now uncomfortable to look at."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,17.0,3,4,"Lacks Offline Mode  I get that the app needs to sync. However, there are times in a day, and these times add up, where I won't have access to the net. So, the fact that i can't log my habits offline is a real upset. Gamifying tasks is not for me."
com.klinker.android.twitter_l,16.96923076923077,3,6,"Bought this twice now... Sucked it up, bought this app again, definitely isn't as polished as I had hoped (in comparison to the old version). Tweets rarely get marked as 'Retweeted', I have no idea if it actually worked unless I check from a separate app. Sometimes I dont even get the option to Like or Retweet something because a circular loading icon sits under the Tweet indefinitely. I do like the ability to add lists that I can swipe to ala TweetDeck, just wish their was an easier way to Like/Retweet things without opening them."
com.battlelancer.seriesguide,16.93846153846154,3,0,It is beyond annoying that this app becomes unusable if trakt has connectivity problems. Why is it not possible to just set episodes watched on device and let it sync whenever it can get a connection instead in real time.
com.klinker.android.twitter_l,16.9,2,14,"I've had this app for years and loved it, but viewing any kind of media on it is a true test of patience anymore. You can literally wait minutes for a single photo to load and it still won't, regardless of your network speed. Download a pic and it won't even open the photo when you click on the notification when it's done. WAY too much effort and time wasted to do such a basic thing. I don't want to switch apps, but this is not even functional for me at the moment."
com.klinker.android.twitter_l,16.9,3,18,Net_scheduler bug that keeps the device active all time. Mobile active radio bug... Battery sucker. Always on backround and with automatic system boot... Please... Favorite users should be restored in any way
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.846153846153843,1,0,"Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.846153846153843,2,4,Galaxy S10 on Android 10. FTUE is busted. First two slides don't load. You get to the character creation and the avatar and all of the customize options are invisible/don't display. Please fix or mark the app as incompatible with Android 10.
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.846153846153843,1,0,"The two starting pages were blank, same as character customization. I saw another comment and there's any new version to update. I was excited to try this app but I couldn't :("
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.846153846153843,1,0,"Frequent crashes Within a few minutes of installation, the app would crash regularly when swiping back and forth, or navigating by the headers. CM13 on Moto G (2nd   gen)."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.846153846153843,1,0,"Couldn't even get past avatar creation without it bugging out. If this app worked, it could very easily become one of my favourites, but alas."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.846153846153843,1,0,It's broken. I try to create my account and I can't even use the name I want or customize my character. It's just broken. Nothing displays.
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.826923076923073,3,1,"I liked this app and did find it useful for a while to help keep on track with things. However, I found myself losing motivation to use it because the graphics are hideous, and levelling up has no real point. Also, the inability to have tasks repeat on a certain day each month, and general lack of customization for task repetition, made it useless for a lot of things I need to do."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.826923076923073,3,1,I like your app. But sometimes internet connection is unstable in our place and causes my dailies to be not checked when it happens. I hope we can check our tasks and just sync them when connection is already available. Ill give 5 stars for it..
com.battlelancer.seriesguide,16.784615384615385,2,4,This app has gone a bit stale tbh...No major update or redesign for years. Needs a better trending and discovery tab to find hot new shows... Searching for shows is also quite slow and flunky compared to almost all other tracker apps. Needs more feature asap otherwise this long time user might have to look somewhere else
com.battlelancer.seriesguide,16.75769230769231,3,1,"Nice looking, but can be confusing. I love the style of the app, it's just confusing sometimes.   I wish it was simpler, also options to add new content to Watchlists and Collections, without going into to many menus.  I think both Movies and TV sections should be identical. Instead, to find my Collection and Watchlist in TV, I have to press Add button first, which doesn't make sense :P"
com.klinker.android.twitter_l,16.715384615384615,2,8,"App has great potential but is very buggy. Widget never refreshes. Doesn't matter how many times I tap the refresh button, or where I tap it, it never reloads and shows same content. I prefer setting the refresh to manual and refreshing when I want but this widget does not work properly."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.71153846153846,2,15,"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely. I went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere. The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always..."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.71153846153846,2,15,"App performance is inconsistent. Frequently has trouble syncing without restarting the app and many random issues, for example lately I have not been able to change equipment and rearrange tasks. Nice concept but not when I have to work so hard to use the app"
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.69230769230769,2,8,"Good idea, bad execution. They have a gem in the rough. If they can figure out how to fix all the little inconsistencies and give people more than one way to play, it will be worth retrying. Until then, other life gamification apps exist."
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.67307692307692,2,1,"It's great in theory, but good lord are there a lot of bugs! Constant crashes and freezes, disappearing tasks, weird list glitches... Come on, guys. Get it together."
com.klinker.android.twitter_l,16.657692307692308,3,3,"Pretty good Much better than the native Twitter client, but not as good as Tweetbot. Annoying bug wherein new entries at the top of a feed are not properly accounted for in the computed scroll position, resulting in many duplicate entries being displayed when slowly scrolling down through a very active list."
com.klinker.android.twitter_l,16.653846153846153,1,2,"editing the review after using the app for 5-6 days and it's not worth buying. 1. DMs will always disappoint, disappearance of chats if you log out of app, loading issue, and also if you use official twitter website on desktop to send some message, that msg wont get loaded in the convo in this app. 2. can't recognise navigation bar, doesn't work even after changing settings. 3. can't catch notification from twitter app either, tried many times. 4. link previews load very slow, links open fine"
com.habitrpg.android.habitica,16.576923076923073,3,0,Bug with To Dos There is a bug with the To Do section where I cannot change the due date. I set the date I want and save it but the task does not update and keeps damaging me. If you could fix this it would be 5 stars as this has been a really useful app so far!
